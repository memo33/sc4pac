  description: |
    This is an SD terrain mod, compatible with software rendering mode.

    A desert terrain mod made especially for the Canyonlands map and the Monument Valley map, but it can be used with any map. This mod changes the ground textures of the undeveloped areas of your city to create an orange and rusty rock desert at low elevations. At medium-high elevations, the land becomes greener, and at very high elevations, there is snow. In total, this mod applies approximately four times as many textures to the terrain as the unmodded game, and significantly more than the Columbus Mod.

    This package comes with the Lowkee33 Seasonal Flora Patch pre-applied.

  description: |
    This is an SD terrain mod, compatible with software rendering mode.

    An orange and white sandstone desert mod, loosely based on the Colorado Plateau area of the southwestern US. This mod changes the ground textures of the undeveloped areas of your city to give it a southwestern US look. Lower elevations are orange sandstone or orange dirt with areas of sagebrush and other sparse vegetation. Higher up is a band of white rock/dirt/clay, also with areas of sparse vegetation. As the elevation increases above the band of white rock/dirt/clay, the terrain becomes densely covered with sagebrush, and then, above the sagebrush, green and grassy. On very high mountains, you will find flowering alpine meadows, rock outcroppings, scree slopes, and snowy ravines.

    This package comes with the Lowkee33 Seasonal Flora Patch pre-applied.

    This is an SD terrain mod, compatible with software rendering mode.

    An Italianish terrain mod inspired by Mikebear's Italian/Mediterranean BAT series. Based loosely on Southern Italy and/or the California Coast. This mod changes the ground textures of the undeveloped areas of your city to give them a somewhat green/slightly brown appearance: lots of grassy ground with flowers, along with a wide variety of forest floor and other textures. At low/medium elevations, this mod is slightly less green (slightly more brown) than the Columbus mod, but with more detail and a greater variety of textures. At higher elevations, you will find greener ground with flowering alpine meadows, rock outcroppings, scree slopes, and snowy ravines. High mountaintops are snowcapped.

    This package comes with the Lowkee33 Seasonal Flora Patch pre-applied.
