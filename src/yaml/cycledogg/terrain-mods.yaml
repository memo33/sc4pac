    This mod changes the ground textures of the undeveloped areas of your city to give it a "badlands" look: lots of sagebrush and chalky white slopes, as well as a variety of grasslands. At higher elevations, you will find flowering alpine meadows, rock outcroppings, scree slopes, and snowy ravines.

  description: |
    This mod changes the ground textures of the undeveloped areas of your city to give it a southwestern US look. Lower elevations are orange sandstone or orange dirt with areas of sagebrush and other sparse vegetation. Higher up is a band of white rock/dirt/clay, also with areas of sparse vegetation. As the elevation increases above the band of white rock/dirt/clay, the terrain becomes densely covered with sagebrush, and then, above the sagebrush, green and grassy. On very high mountains, you will find flowering alpine meadows, rock outcroppings, scree slopes, and snowy ravines.

At low/medium elevations, this mod is slightly less green (slightly more brown) than the Columbus mod, but with more detail and a greater variety of textures. At higher elevations, you will find greener ground with flowering alpine meadows, rock outcroppings, scree slopes, and snowy ravines. High mountaintops are snowcapped.

version: "3.0"
subfolder: "170-terrain"
info:
  summary: "A very green terrain mod based on the Olympic peninsula in western Washington State, USA."
  conflicts: "Incompatible with all other terrain mods – only one terrain mod may be installed. Compatible with seasonal tree controllers."
  description: |
    This mod changes the ground textures of the undeveloped areas of your city to give it a lush Olympic Peninsula-like appearance: lots of mossy ground suitable for rain forests, as well as a wide variety of other forest floor and grass textures. At higher elevations, you will find flowering alpine meadows, rock outcroppings, scree slopes, and snowy ravines.

    This is an SD terrain mod, compatible with software rendering mode.
