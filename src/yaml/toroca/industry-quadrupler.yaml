  summary: "Quadruple the number of jobs of Maxis industrial buildings"
  warning: |-
    If you install this mod in a pre-existing region, expect demand for industry to fall sharply.
    It is advisable to remove a large part of the industrial zones from each city.
  conflicts: "Incompatible with CAM, compatible with IRM."
  description: |
    This mod increases the number of jobs provided by industrial buildings to a more realistic level.
    Factories in fact employ hundreds or thousands of people,
    but in SimCity 4 there is hardly a single operation that offers more than 100 jobs.

    With the quadrupled variant of this mod, the number of jobs is quadrupled for all Maxis industrial buildings (apart from filler buildings).

    With the standard variant, the mod is not installed, but an empty placeholder package is installed instead.
