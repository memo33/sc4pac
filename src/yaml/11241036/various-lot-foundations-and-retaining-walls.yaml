  summary: Various Lot Foundations and Retaining Walls
  description: |
    Some lots, when being placed on slopes, will either raise the floor beneath them, or cut into the hill. In the former case, a lot foundation is being created, in the latter, a retaining wall.

    This pack has turned some textures by Maxis or other authors into lot foundations and retaining walls. This plugin therefore acts as a dependency for plugin developers, providing them with the necessary textures and exemplar files.
