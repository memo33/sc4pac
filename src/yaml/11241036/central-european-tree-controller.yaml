  warning: >-
    If using this controller in seasonal mode, seasonal trees must be planted on September 1st.
    When switching to another tree controller, always remove any and all trees planted with your previous tree controller *before* uninstalling your old tree controller.

    If you want to remove the tree controller, there are few helper files are available on Simtropolis.
  conflicts: >-
    If using the seasonal controller, it is only compatible with terrain mods that include the Seasonal Flora Patch.
    Incompatible with all other tree controllers – only one tree controller may be installed at a time.
  description: >
    This plugin provides you with a tree controller, that allows you to plant large forests consisting of trees mostly created by girafe.
    On lower altitudes, leafy trees are being planted, and the higher you go, eventually mixed forests, conifer forests, shrubby plains and meadows with flowers will appear instead.

    There are a few ways to use this tree controller.
    You can use it in seasonal mode, in which case the planted flora will change appearance.
    Alternatively you can choose one of the non-seasonal variants: summer, fall or winter.
    With this variant, the trees will always look the same, regardless of the in-game time.
    This is useful if you don't want the trees to change color while playing, but occasionally want to take screenshots in fall or winter mode.
    In this case, just use sc4pac variant reset CETC.mode and then run sc4pac update again.
