# Summary of included packages:
# - nam:network-addon-mod        --> includes nearly everything, with optional components as dependencies
# - nam:network-addon-mod-core   --> includes only mandatory stuff
#
# The Core depends on (internal) packages like:
# - nam:network-addon-mod-controller
# - nam:textures
# - ...
#
# Optional components only depend on the Core:
# - nam:real-highway-mod
# - nam:network-widening-mod

      This meta-package bundles all the core and most optional components of the NAM.

      To exclude some optional components, check the list of Dependencies and install them individually (instead of installing this entire package).

      The minimal NAM installation includes just `pkg=nam:network-addon-mod-core`.
      All the other dependencies are optional.
      (An even smaller alternative is NAM Lite: `pkg=nam:network-addon-mod-lite`.)

      Additionally, you can install the following optional components (not included):
      * `pkg=nam:additional-transit-stations`
      * `pkg=nam-team:tunnel-and-slope-mod`

      It also includes some degree of diagonal functionality for all networks, transitions to connect NWM networks to Maxis networks or other NAM override networks, a series of Wide-Radius Curve pieces, and neighbor connector puzzle pieces for selected networks.

    summary: Hybrid Railway
    description: |-
      The Hybrid Railway, or HRW, is an intermediate FLEX based dual-network that provides for both heavy and High Speed (Monorail) traffic.
      Specifications of the HRW include catenaries, textures that are the same as the RRW, as well as including some purpose-built textures for specific pieces.

      The HRW is a FLEX network utilising dual-networking (Rail and Monorail) pieces meaning it can only be constructed with FLEX pieces provided in the menus.
      To gain full functionality, all items require placing FLEX pieces, with drawability only relevant for transitioning to the RRW.
