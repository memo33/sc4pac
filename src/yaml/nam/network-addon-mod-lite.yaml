    summary: "NAM Lite, a more compact variant of the NAM, including just the most essential NAM features"
    description: |
      NAM Lite is a minimal standalone package that includes features such as:
      * the Traffic Simulator (`pkg=nam:traffic-simulator`)
      * the Automata Controller (`pkg=nam:automata-controller`)
      * additional interchanges for the game's base Highway system (the "Maxis Highways")
      * Diagonal Streets
      * Roundabouts
      * Euro Road texture options
      * Hole Diggers/Ground Raisers

      Additionally, you can install the following optional component (not included):
      * `pkg=nam-team:tunnel-and-slope-mod`

      If you want to install more features not included in NAM Lite, install one of the following packages instead:
      * `pkg=nam:network-addon-mod` (full NAM, includes everything)
      * `pkg=nam:network-addon-mod-core` (NAM without optional components which can be installed separately on top)
