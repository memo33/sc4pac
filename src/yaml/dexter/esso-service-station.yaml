  summary: ESSO Service Station
  description: |-
    ESSO is one of the biggest brands of fuel stations in the UK, and are found in many locations including cities and rural areas.

    This particular version is designed to be used with the RHW network, and linked up with FA-MIS ramps to simulate a setup commonly found on busy arterial roads in the UK and Ireland.

    - Plop Cost: ยง150
    - Monthly Cost: ยง0 (privately operated)
    - Lot Size: 5x3

    You will find it in the Landmarks menu.

    This lot is for eye candy only, and is NOT transit-enabled. In order for it to look decent, it is strongly recommended that you plop FA-MIS pieces either side of the lot.
