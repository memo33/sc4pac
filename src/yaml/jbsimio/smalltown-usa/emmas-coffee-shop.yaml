  summary: "Emma's Coffee Shop, part of the Smalltown, USA Series by JBSimio"
  description: |
    Emma's Coffee Shop is the sixth release in the Smalltown, USA series. This
    package contains both growable and ploppable versions of the building.
    The ploppable version shares the same jobs, pollution, etc. as the growable.
    The only differences are a plop cost of 1700 and bulldoze cost of 170.
