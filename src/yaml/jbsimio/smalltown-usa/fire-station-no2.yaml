  summary: "Fire Station No 2, part of the Smalltown, USA Series by JBSimio"
  description: |
    Fire Station No 2 is the eleventh release in the Smalltown, USA Series.
    The building is a modified version of the Fire Sticks Pool Hall released here
    earlier and made at the request of several SimTropolis members.  This is a
    working fire station that can stand alone or be used in a wall to wall setting.
    All costs and statistics mirror the small fire station included with SC4, but
    the coverage area has been doubled.  This was done mainly for realism in small
    farming communities where the original coverage radius was far too small.
