  summary: "Smalltown Muse, part of the Smalltown, USA Series by JBSimio"
  description: |
    The Smalltown Muse is the eleventh release in the Smalltown, USA series.
    This package contains both growable and ploppable versions of the building.
    The ploppable version shares the same jobs, pollution, etc. as the growable.
    The only differences are a plop cost of 2300 and bulldoze cost of 230.
