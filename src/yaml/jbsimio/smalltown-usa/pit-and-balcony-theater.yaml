  summary: "Pit and Balcony Theater, part of the Smalltown, USA Series by JBSimio"
  description: |
    The Pit & Balcony Theater is the twelfth release in the Smalltown, USA series.
    This package contains both growable and ploppable versions of the building.
    The ploppable version shares the same jobs, pollution, etc. as the growable.
    The only differences are a plop cost of 1400 and bulldoze cost of 140.
