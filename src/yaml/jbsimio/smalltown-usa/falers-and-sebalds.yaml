  summary: "Faler's and Sebald's, part of the Smalltown, USA Series by JBSimio"
  description: |
    Faler's Drugstore and Sebald's Bakery is the first release in the
    Smalltown, USA series. It contains both growable and ploppable versions.
    The ploppable version shares the same jobs, pollution, etc. as the growable.
    The only differences are a plop cost of 1200 and bulldoze cost of 120.
