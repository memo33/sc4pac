  summary: "Ted's Meat Market, part of the Smalltown, USA Series by JBSimio"
  description: |
    Ted's Meat Market is the tenth release in the Smalltown, USA series.
    This package contains both growable and ploppable versions of the building.
    The ploppable version shares the same jobs, pollution, etc. as the growable.
    The only differences are a plop cost of 2000 and bulldoze cost of 200.
