  summary: "Clinton Clock Tower, part of the Smalltown, USA Series by JBSimio"
  description: |
    The Clinton Clock Tower is the sixteenth release in the Smalltown, USA series.
    This package contains both growable and ploppable versions of the building.
    The ploppable version shares the same jobs, pollution, etc. as the growable.
    The only differences are a plop cost of 3700 and bulldoze cost of 370.
