  summary: "Herter's Music Store, part of the Smalltown, USA Series by JBSimio"
  description: |
    Herter's Music Store is the second release in the Smalltown, USA series.
    This small "filler" building contains both growable and ploppable versions.
    The ploppable version shares the same jobs, pollution, etc. as the growable.
    The only differences are a plop cost of 900 and bulldoze cost of 90.
