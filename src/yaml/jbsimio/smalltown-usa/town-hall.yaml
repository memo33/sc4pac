  summary: "Town Hall, part of the Smalltown, USA Series by JBSimio"
  description: |
    The Town Hall is the fourteenth release in the Smalltown, USA series.
    There are two different model versions, both with two lot sizes.
    The original upload contained a growable residential version which has been
    excluded from this package.

    This BAT serves primarily as a police station and city hall combined into one
    building.  For the most part, the police attributes are similar to the Maxis
    large precinct, although the protection area has been doubled.  Extra $$ jobs,
    YIMBY and landmark effects have been added to simulate the benefits of the
    Maxis city hall.
