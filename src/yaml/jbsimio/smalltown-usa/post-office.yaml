  summary: "Stanley Mercer Building, part of the Smalltown, USA Series by JBSimio"
  description: |
    The Post Office is the seventeenth release in the Smalltown, USA Series.
    There are three versions included in this package.  The first is a landmark
    that does nothing more than sit and look pretty.  The second is a landmark
    lot which provides CO$$ jobs, but gives no further benefits.  The third is
    a reward version which includes several nifty little things, thanks to BarbyW.
    Your city will need to be over ten years old and have a population of 5,000
    or more to unlock the reward version.  In return, when built, the post office
    will not only provide civic jobs, but also boost your city's EQ, slightly
    increase commercial demand, and put a little money in the treasury as part of
    a business deal.  All three versions use the One Flag Many Nations Mod by
    Pegasus.  All three versions also use the Postal Truck Mod by Ardecila to
    spawn postal vehicles all over town.
