  summary: "Sonnet's Corner Shops, part of the Smalltown, USA Series by JBSimio"
  description: |
    Sonnet's Corner Shops is the fifth release in the Smalltown, USA series.
    This package contains both growable and ploppable versions of the building.
    This is a corner lot, meaning it will only grow with roads along the front and right sides of the lot.
    The ploppable version shares the same jobs, pollution, etc. as the growable.
    The only differences are a plop cost of 2500 and bulldoze cost of 240.
