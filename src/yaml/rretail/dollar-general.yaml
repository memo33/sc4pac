  summary: Dollar General
  description: |-
    Dollar General is becoming one of the biggest – yet smallest at the same time – stores in the United States. Almost any town with a population of 1,000 is likely to have one and as of late they've even opened in smaller populated areas with less population with one of the designs seen here.

    This Dollar General comes with both long and wide variations of the newest modern design.

    -   The long version is a 3x5 lot with 29 jobs
    -   The wide version is a 4x4 lot with 27 jobs.
