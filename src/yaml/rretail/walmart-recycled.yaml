  summary: Walmart Recycled
  description: |-
    Based off of what happened to an old Walmart in Erie, PA, I’ve redone my non-supercenter Walmart into what now occupies the space in real life. The idea is Walmart relocated leaving behind an empty building and over time these three brands featured – Burlington, Hobby Lobby and a newly constructed Old Navy – came to fill the space. And the same thing can happen in your town too if you so wish.
