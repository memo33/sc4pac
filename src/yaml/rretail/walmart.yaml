  summary: Walmart
  description: |-
    This style of Walmart is based around a non-supercenter design. The building itself takes inspiration from the real world location in Hornell, NY. Walmart mainly operates these smaller stores in areas where the store is in a plaza with a grocery store and because of this there are usually restrictions in place that prevent it from expanding.

    11x12 lot with 652 jobs
