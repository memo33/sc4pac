  description: |-
    Motel 6, which was founded in Santa Barbara, CA in 1962, is a chain of privately owned budget motels in the United States and Canada. The hotel brand is owned by The Blackstone Group. Two local building contractors: William Becker and Paul Greene founded the company as a motel with low rates. A rate of $6 was decided upon at the time which would cover various costs, hence the reason for the company name "Motel 6"
