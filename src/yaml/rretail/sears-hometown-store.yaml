  summary: Sears Hometown Store
  description: |-
    Sears Hometown stores are independently owned stores that sell hardware, appliances and lawn-and-garden supplies. Most stores are independently owned and are usually located in smaller communities that donâ€™t support a large format Sears or sometimes are used to replace a larger format Sears store in the same market that previously closed.
