  summary: Ruler Foods
  description: |-
    Owned by Kroger, Ruler Foods is a discount warehouse grocery store that operates stores in Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky, Missouri, and Tennessee. The concept is very similar to Aldi, as customers bag their own groceries at the checkout, and rent shopping carts for 25 cents. One key difference is that 80% of the products sold at Ruler Foods are Kroger Brand. Ruler Foods was previously owned by JayC Food Stores, a company that Kroger purchased in 1999.
