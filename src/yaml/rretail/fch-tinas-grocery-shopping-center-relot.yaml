#   summary: FCH Tina's Grocery Shopping Center Relot
#   description: |-
#     I've decided to embark upon a journey to redo a select few of my previous relots. Next up is just one of many shopping centers using existing buildings already made for SimCity 4. If a brand isn't available to use or is way out of scale when next to other buildings, I cannot use it as part of these shopping centers.

#     This shopping center is ideal for small communities and meant to compliment the previous small town plazas, but will fit and work by itself as well.

#     The lot itself is on a **10x8** space.
