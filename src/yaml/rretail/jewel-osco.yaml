  description: |-
    Serving the Chicago area and it surrounding suburbs, Jewel-Osco is a supermarket chain headquartered out of Itasca, Illinois. The company has grown to 188 stores and is a subsidiary of parent company Albertsons. Jewel-Osco’s roots are traced back to 1899 when its founder, Frank Vernon Skiff, used the company (then simply named Jewel) as a door-to-door coffee delivery service. Eventually the chain would expand into delivering non-perishable groceries and finally into a grocery store. A 1961 merger with Chicago’s Osco Drug stores would set the name for the company’s new stores starting in 1962.
