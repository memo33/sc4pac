  summary: Pathmark
  description: |-
    Pathmark- as it would be eventually be called- was founded in 1968 as an independent supermarket chain. Perhaps better known as a chain, Pathmark once operated a chain of supermarkets throughout the New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Maryland. The company would later be purchased by competing supermarket chain A&P in 2007.

    Due to A&P’s 2015 bankruptcy, all Pathmark stores were liquidated and closed. The intellectual property is now owned by Allegiance Retail Services, a retailers’ cooperative headquartered in Iselin, NJ. Pathmark currently operates one location in East Flatbush, Brooklyn, NY.
