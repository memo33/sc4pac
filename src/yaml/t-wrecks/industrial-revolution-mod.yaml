  description: >
    This expansion package for the Industrial Revolution Mod (IRM) contains a
    set of custom-made lots that can grow as fillers between industrial
    facilities, mainly tanks/silos and warehouses. Fillers are particularly
    important for I-M because Maxis apparently forgot to include some small 1x1
    lots to fill the gaps between other structures.
