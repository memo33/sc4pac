  summary: "Replacement of all Maxis trees on lots and roadsides"
  description: >
    This mod replaces all Maxis trees on lots with beautiful HD trees. Lots
    already existing in your city will automatically switch to the new trees.
    Whatever grows or is plopped subsequently will show the new trees in place
    of the old Maxis ones. Besides, it will replace roadside trees that
    occasionally show up at the sides of streets and roads.

    All Mayor Mode and God Mode flora in the city map will remain unaffected.
    The growing lot flora will also be replaced, but with full-grown trees.
