  summary: No More Neighbour Connection Arrows
  description: |-
    Tired of those oversized road signs, dangerously placed on your centrelines?

    This mod removes the yellow arrows that appear on all networks, when connected to a neighbouring city.

    The functionality of the connections is preserved. As a result, querying the network still reveals the information dialog (see screenshot). You may find this useful for creating City Journals, or to just make your cities more appealing.

    Note: A while ago there was a similar mod on the STEX, based around this concept, but for some reason is no longer available. So for the benefit of the community, I've now recreated it. ![*:)](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/default_1.gif ":)")
