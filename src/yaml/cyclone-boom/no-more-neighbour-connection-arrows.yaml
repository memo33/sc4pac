  summary: No More Neighbour Connection Arrows
  description: |-
    Tired of those oversized road signs, dangerously placed on your centrelines?

    This mod removes the yellow arrows that appear on all networks when connected to a neighbouring city.

    The functionality of the connections is preserved. As a result, querying the network still reveals the information dialog. You may find this useful for creating City Journals, or to just make your cities more appealing.
