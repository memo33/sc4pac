  summary: Web Button Improvement Mod
  description: |-
    Ever found yourself being led astray into a web of nothingness?

    Solving a problem which has been prevalent for many years now, this mod contains 4 options to modify the now defunct **SimCity.ea.com** website button in the Region View screen.

    **Option A**   **(Click Prevented)**  
    Prevents the click (and features a hover over dialog).  
    Upon click a harmless sound will play which is only for effect. ![*;)](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/default_2.gif "*;)")

    ![01 - Preview Option A - Click Prevented.png](https://www.simtropolis.com/objects/attachments/monthly_2020_05/5eabe661e8183_01-PreviewOptionA-ClickPrevented.png.09d301e92ec04d302c3aa0b9899262ed.png)

    **Option B**   **(Replaced with Exit)**  
    Replaces the Web button with the Exit button exactly in the same location.

    **Option C**   **(Simply Removed)**  
    Just makes the Web button no longer visible, meaning there's a gap where it was.

    ![03 - Preview Option C - Simply Removed.png](https://www.simtropolis.com/objects/attachments/monthly_2020_05/5eabe66cd97eb_03-PreviewOptionC-SimplyRemoved.png.a665b87195c68c99636d6e76e89c6f32.png)

    **Option D**   **(Simtropolis Link)**  
    The Web button is still available, but now links directly to Simtropolis instead.

    ![04 - Preview Option D - Simtropolis Link.png](https://www.simtropolis.com/objects/attachments/monthly_2020_05/5eabe67069aff_04-PreviewOptionD-SimtropolisLink.png.43cf680bd5de8b7b20d2055333d267cc.png)

    Added 1st October 2020:  
    Or alternatively, you may wish to use this version:

    [Web Button Improvement Mod\_v1.0 - EA Archived Link for Option D.zip](https://community.simtropolis.com/applications/core/interface/file/attachment.php?id=63400)

    As per the suggestion [@Admiral Moo](https://community.simtropolis.com/profile/751083-admiral-moo/) made in the comments, this links to the Wayback Machine's archived page for the original **SimCity.ea.com** site which was the target of the old web link.

    \----------

    There are two versions of each option.

    One which supports running SC4 in full screen mode, and the other in windowed mode.

    **Installation**

    *This mod uses the standard process of installing SC4 content.*

    *There are no dependencies.*

    Choose a folder depending on how you wish to play the game (windowed or full screen).

    Then copy **ONE** of the .dat file options into your Plugins folder.

    All versions are compatible with the [Raise the UI Mod](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23771-raise-the-ui-mod/) which is still required for raising the interface once entering a city. If using this, make sure to copy a chosen file into the same folder.

    The z\_ at the beginning will ensure mine loads last, and both can work together properly.

    Hopefully preventing the web button being clicked (or making it functional) comes in useful. 

    Special Mention

    Thanks to [@Terring](https://community.simtropolis.com/profile/235805-terring/) for inspiration of the idea [from his thread](https://community.simtropolis.com/forums/topic/759092-lets-disable-a-relic-of-the-past/).

    Also to good friend  [@CorinaMarie](https://community.simtropolis.com/profile/737259-corinamarie/)  for helping with preliminary testing on her multiple computers, and giving feedback and ideas to make this mini project properly possible.
