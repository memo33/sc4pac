    Ever found yourself being led astray into a web of nothingness?

    Solving a problem which has been prevalent for many years now, this mod contains 4 options to modify the now defunct **SimCity.ea.com** website button in the Region View screen.

    [![Buy me a coffee](https://www.simtropolis.com/library/misc/CB_Coffee_v42.png)](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/cycloneboom)

    **Option A**   **(Click Prevented)**  
    Prevents the click (and features a hover over dialog).  
    Upon click a harmless sound will play which is only for effect. ![*;)](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/default_2.gif "*;)")

    ![01 - Preview Option A - Click Prevented.png](https://www.simtropolis.com/objects/attachments/monthly_2020_05/5eabe661e8183_01-PreviewOptionA-ClickPrevented.png.09d301e92ec04d302c3aa0b9899262ed.png)

    **Option B**   **(Replaced with Exit)**  
    Replaces the Web button with the Exit button exactly in the same location.

    ![02 - Preview Option B - Replaced with Exit.png](https://www.simtropolis.com/objects/attachments/monthly_2020_05/5eabe6686852a_02-PreviewOptionB-ReplacedwithExit.png.889aae6a98bc56e85aceca3773ca8f92.png)

    **Option C**   **(Simply Removed)**  
    Just makes the Web button no longer visible, meaning there's a gap where it was.

    ![03 - Preview Option C - Simply Removed.png](https://www.simtropolis.com/objects/attachments/monthly_2020_05/5eabe66cd97eb_03-PreviewOptionC-SimplyRemoved.png.a665b87195c68c99636d6e76e89c6f32.png)

    **Option D**   **(Simtropolis Link)**  
    The Web button is still available, but now links directly to Simtropolis instead.

    ![04 - Preview Option D - Simtropolis Link.png](https://www.simtropolis.com/objects/attachments/monthly_2020_05/5eabe67069aff_04-PreviewOptionD-SimtropolisLink.png.43cf680bd5de8b7b20d2055333d267cc.png)

    Added 1st October 2020:  
    Or alternatively, you may wish to use this version:

    [Web Button Improvement Mod\_v1.0 - EA Archived Link for Option D.zip](https://community.simtropolis.com/applications/core/interface/file/attachment.php?id=63400)

    As per the suggestion [@Admiral Moo](https://community.simtropolis.com/profile/751083-admiral-moo/) made in the comments, this links to the Wayback Machine's archived page for the original **SimCity.ea.com** site which was the target of the old web link.

    \----------

    There are two versions of each option.

    One which supports running SC4 in full screen mode, and the other in windowed mode.

    **Installation**

    *This mod uses the standard process of installing SC4 content.*

    *There are no dependencies.*

    Choose a folder depending on how you wish to play the game (windowed or full screen).

    Then copy **ONE** of the .dat file options into your Plugins folder.

    All versions are compatible with the [Raise the UI Mod](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23771-raise-the-ui-mod/) which is still required for raising the interface once entering a city. If using this, make sure to copy a chosen file into the same folder.

    The z\_ at the beginning will ensure mine loads last, and both can work together properly.

    Hopefully preventing the web button being clicked (or making it functional) comes in useful. I know I've clicked it unintentionally a few times too! ![*:P](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/default_3.gif "*:P")

    Special Mention

    Thanks to [@Terring](https://community.simtropolis.com/profile/235805-terring/) for inspiration of the idea [from his thread](https://community.simtropolis.com/forums/topic/759092-lets-disable-a-relic-of-the-past/).

    Also to my good friend  [@CorinaMarie](https://community.simtropolis.com/profile/737259-corinamarie/)  for helping me with preliminary testing on her multiple computers, and giving feedback and ideas to make this mini project properly possible. I really appreciate it as ever. ![*:)](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/default_1.gif "*:)")
