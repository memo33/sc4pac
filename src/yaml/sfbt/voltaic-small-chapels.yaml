  summary: "Two small chapels by voltaic"
  description: |
    Especially in the Alpine area, small chapels that only hold slightly more than a handful of people can be found everywhere.
    Here, the devout members of the surrounding farms and travellers are gathering.
    The small church "Maria Hilf" is located near the Ludescherberg mountain in Vorarlberg, Austria.
    The second model in this set is a chapel in Leutasch.
