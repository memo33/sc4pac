  summary: "Modern bus and tram stops by Fluggi"
  description: |
    This download contains 17 lots with several bus and tram stops for your city.
    There are three different models: A simple bus stop with a glass covered roof made by Fluggi which can be found everywhere in Germany,
    and two other stops (one wide and one narrow version) with a roof in three different colors made by khoianh94 which are inspired from the ones in Munich, Germany.
    The narrow bus stops can be plopped directly on a road.
