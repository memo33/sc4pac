  summary: Playground Props by Sam Johnson
  description: |
    This extensive set of playground props has been created by Sam Johnson for use on his Moscow pre-fab lots, but they can be used on any (preferrably R-ยง) residential lots and playgrounds. All props are available in prop families with different colors, so no lot looks the same. Most of them were modeled after real-life playgrounds in Eastern Europe.
