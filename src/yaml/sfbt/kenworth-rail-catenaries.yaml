  summary: SFBT Kenworth Rail Catenaries v2
  description: |-
    Catenaries (overhead wires) for railways are mainly used to supply electric locomotives with power. They consist of a special wire that hangs above the tracks. The height can differ from country to country. The pantograph that is mounted on top of a locomotive is in constant touch with the wires, so it can conduct power to the electric generators and engines of the vehicle.  
    This set includes 17 different lots that can be placed next to your railway tracks, some of them are transit enabled and can be placed directly onto the tracks, this is useful in tight spaces, such as in downtown situations. All lots feature a transparent base texture and can be used with all available terrain mods.

    The lots can be found in the lower part of the power menu (or in the **Miscellaneous Power Utilities Submenu**) and also provide support for `pkg=memo:submenus-dll`. Place them every other two tiles next to your railway tracks. The lots don't have a base texture, so you can use them with every terrain mod. The catenary props extend over the lot borders and show up directly above the adjacent tracks. Some lots are transit enabled and can be placed directly onto the tracks. This is useful in tight situations, such as the tracks in front of a large railway station. It is advisable to use a rail texture mod, such as PEG's and Swamper77's "No Rail Dirt" mod or PEG's "Alternate Rail Set Mod", which will prevent ugly brown textures below the tracks.
