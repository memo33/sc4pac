  summary: Peterycristi Props
  description: |
    This prop pack contains 25 different props from Berlin and the surrounding area. The props are intended for usage on Berlin-related lots for SimCity 4. The pack only serves as a dependency, there are no lot or similar included. If you like to see those props in your game, you will have to install corresponding lots, or create your own. In the Lot Editor, all props are listed with the prefix "SFBT_PYC_...", so they are neatly grouped for easier finding.
