  summary: ARAL Gas Station
  description: |
    This set contains two different versions of a German ARAL Gas Station, one with a trapezoid glass roof, and one with a round glass roof. Both lots are available as growable and ploppable with jobs. The download also contains a large ARAL sign that can be placed next to a highway exit or a central artery road.

    ARAL is the largest German gas station carrier. The company was purchased by British Petrol (BP) recently, but since ARAL is far more well-known, and since they had way more gas stations than BP in Germany, they re-branded all German BP stations to ARAL.
