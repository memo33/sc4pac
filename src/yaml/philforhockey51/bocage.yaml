  summary: Bocage
  description: |-
    104..(I lost count more than 104 less than 115 .. maybe) Neutral Lots with fences and dirt edge texture overlays with girafe seasonal flora.
    Multiple sets of lots for placement along the edge of your farm fields to create Bocage type areas between fields.
    The lots include fence props from the BSC ALN RRP fences and overlay textures from the BSC Textures to create a dirt edge along the borders of your farm fields.
    The lots are divided into three groups; Side, Center, and 2x2. Each of these groups are subdivided into sets with some varied props/paths.  
    All the groups/sets come in two versions, one version Without a Base Texture and one version With a Base Texture. Download the version your system can handle..can your system use dll mods?
    For the No Base version there is no base texture so whichever terrain you use will show through, this requires the Transparent Texture (Water Bug) Fix DLL by memo
    For the With Base version the base texture used is a grass texture base (basetexture 0xf8e06e30) created by hugues aroux's Scoty factory for his Scoty Field Paths & Hedges set.
    This texture was made with multiple support texture versions for different grass terrain mods. When downloading the Scoty hedgepath dependency you can select a texture that matches your terrain.   
    Group - Side - Lots(45ish) in this group have a fence and dirt edge on one side. The group has three sets.
             Set - Side - this set has a variety of straights, corners, and diagonals with just 'nature' beyond the fence.
             Set - Side Trail - this set includes a dirt path trail beyond the fence
             Set - Side Fieldpath - this set includes fieldpath textures from the Scoty Field Paths & Hedges set beyond the fence
    Group - Center - Lots(37ish) in this group have a fence and dirt edge of both sides of the lot. The group has two sets.
             Set - Center - this set has a variety of straights, corners, and ends with just 'nature' between the fences.
             Set - Center Fieldpath - this set includes fieldpath textures from the Scoty Field Paths & Hedges set between the fences.
    Group - 2x2 - Lots(22) in this group are staged on a 2x2 lot, they have the dirt edge and fences and are like a larger Center.
             Set - 2x2 - this set has a variety of straight pieces, a large corner and an end version with 'nature' between the fences there are also Deer props.  
             Set - Bikepath - this set includes lots with a dirt path trail and girafe bikes props between the fences
             Set - Boarpath - this set includes lots with a dirt path trail and Wild Boar props.
    Notes:  
           - All lots can be used together and some are intended to be, one set/lot is not the dependency of another to work but the paths can/should be used for visual connections.
           - All lots make use of SPOT to highlight the fence/dirt side and for path connections.
           - We spoke to the treecutter and it seems Kevin#4 stopped chasing him and started chasing a bike into a bocage, having been raised by wild boar. If you see him let scoty know.
           - For the base texture, if you can use the dll by memo no base is the way to go but if you are unable to use the dll, the with base texture version was made for you.
           - The Side Trail and some 2x2 lots make use of some BSC Textures overlays that include variable layouts that can appear randomly when you plop the lot.
             The multiple straight lots for Trail are to provide variety to the nature but the trail will always vary.
           - Though the Side Trail set can be used to continue the trail from the 2x2 bikepaths, they do not work for all connection points of the 2x2 boarpaths.
           - The 2x2 Boarpath connection points for the trail have slight differences in location on the lot
             meaning not all lots will match up but each lot has at least a couple other lots that have a side that matches the pattern, test out different ones.
           - The 2x2 lots can be rotated to make some connections and needed for some other connections, a good amount of variety is possible for long bocage paths.
