info:
  summary: Fix the capacity of the opera house (Modpacc Zero)
  warning: |-
    If you have previously built opera houses with Toroca's original opera house fix (`pkg=toroca:opera-house-fix`),
    you should keep Toroca's fix in your plugins as well (but only then).
    Otherwise, you can ignore this warning.
  conflicts: This mod is compatible with both the Maxis opera house and Toroca's opera house fix, regardless of load order.
  description: |
    This mod adds a slider to the opera house query to solve a capacity problem
    that can have a major impact on city growth.

    This mod only affects newly built opera houses and leaves pre-existing opera houses untouched.
