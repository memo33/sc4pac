  summary: "Pack of midsize New York styled buildings"
  description: |
    Included is a set of 9 New York style mid-rises.

    They grow as R$$, R$$$, CS$$ and CS$$$ on the New York tile set.
  conflicts: Only DarkNite models exist for these buildings, so the same models are installed with either nightmode setting.
