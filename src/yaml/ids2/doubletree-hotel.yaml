  summary: "Large hotel building (CS$$)"
  description: >
    Based on one in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, this is a fairly nondescript mid-70s hotel and conference center, akin to what you would see in any sizeable American city.

    This building sits on a 7Ã—3 lot and comes in growable and ploppable CS$$ varieties.
