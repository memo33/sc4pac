    Instead of plopping just one lot with a couple of trucks you can now use this pack to create a large modular truck stop around your favorite gas stations and related items.

    The pack contains parking slots for 22.5°, 45° and 90° truck parking, in one-sided and two-sided versions, with left and right variations where needed, all with custom textures. All trucks are timed to appear at different times and locations.

    Note that the 22.5° pieces are modular (*Start, Center, End*) so the parking slots can be made as big as you wish. The 45° pieces come in fixed sizes and enable you to plop down a medium sized area quickly. The two 90° pieces can be used in a modular way as well.

    All the parking slots come with plop helpers that show you the orientation of the parked trucks.

    To tie them up there is a simple set of **access roads** plus a few filler tiles with different items like a **truck wash**, **weigh bridges** and numerous **kiosks**.

    **LIST OF INCLUDED LOTS**

    - 2 pcs. Parking 90° (*modular*)
    - 3 pcs. Parking 45° (*fixed sizes*)
    - 9 pcs. Parking 22.5° (*modular*)
    - 2 pcs. Truckwash
    - 2 pcs. Weigh Bridge
    - 5 pcs. Set of Access Roads
    - 6 pcs. Fillers

    You find the items at or near the end of the 'Transport | Miscellaneous' menu.
