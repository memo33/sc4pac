    DEVELOPER NOTES

    This Nuclear Power Plant is NOT replacing the default nuclear plant. It is NOT conditional either - build it anytime you want (or rather: anytime you can afford it).

    By default the Power Plant comes with a patch to prolong its lifespan. If you prefer your plant to delapidate over time (and possibly blow up), just remove the patch (z_Age_Patch) from your installation.

    You may also want to take appropriate measures against the high pollution and water consumption.

    The lots in 'Part II' are regular IND items (ploppable), providing I-D jobs and tax income. They need power, water and road access - see the in-game menu for details.

    You can use them for your 'Nuclear Facility' or as standalone industrial items.

    All items are located in the 'Utilities | Power' menu.
