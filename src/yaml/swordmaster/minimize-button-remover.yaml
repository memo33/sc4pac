  summary: Minimize button remover
  description: |-
    Ever wanted to take clean snapshots without the minimize button in the lower left corner?
    Then this is for you.

    Once you install this mod, the button just becomes invisible - it's still there, so you can still click on it to bring the UI back. Otherwise, use the shortcut NumLock.

    You probably want to combine this with `pkg=smp:yellow-pause-thingy-remover`.
