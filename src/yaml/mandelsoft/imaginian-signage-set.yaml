  summary: Imaginian Signage Set
  description: |
    This pack contains the fictional Imaginian Signage Set (from the fictional country of Imaginia), which is a mix between the Dutch and German signage style with additional elements from Belgian and Scandinavian signage. The set contains 120 Imaginian-styled signs for your motorways for the most common RHW interchange setups.

    Submenu support is baked in. To take advantage of it, you have to install `pkg=memo:submenus-dll`, after which the lots can be found in the Transit > Highway submenu
