  description: |
    This pack contains the French Signage Set. The set contains 73 French-styled signs for your Autoroutes for the most common RHW interchange setups.

     Submenu support is baked in. To take advantage of it, you have to install `memo:submenus-dll`, after which the lots can be found in the Transit > Highway submenu
