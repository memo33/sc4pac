    **Colossus Addon Mod - Core File** is the main dependency of CAM. This Core File is suitable for both players using CAM and both SPAM and Pure Vanilla players. The mod was developed by the various members of the CAM Team who over time have brought modifications to improve this mod

    Please note that this pack may receive updates in the near future. Do not redistribute without asking first, mostly as doing so would complicate efforts to properly maintain, update, and provide technical support for the pack.

    Extra feature, if you hover over the folders in the installer, you will get some extra information about each contents.

    WARNING: From version 2.5 onward Colossus Addon Mod works only with the digital version (1.1.641) of SimCity 4 (Microsfot Windows and Linux only). If you run CAM 2.5 or later on systems other than those listed, the mod may malfunction and no support is provided.

    **Installation**

    This package is a simple .zip file. Just extract the a_CAM folder to your MyDocuments/SimCity 4/Plugins directory (or equivalent, if you have a custom Plugins folder location).

    It is highly recommended to run the cleanitol with the installer and remove any previous versions from your plugins.
    Optionally in the ~Documents folder in the main ZIP you can find a collective/master and by using either the newer nos.17's SC4 Cleanitol or the older BSC Cleanitol tool you can search and remove old and outdated versions of these files.

    A DLL mod that enables advanced water management by making Fresh Water and Salt Water available.

    This mod alerts the player when a water pump set to use fresh water and salt water is not working, allowing them to receive a warning. Also available is a cheat code ***ScanPumps*** that can be used as a debugging tool for modders.
    
    This mod cannot work without `pkg=cam:colossus-addon-mod-corefile`
