      Install the experimental version of CAM Core

      Installing CAM Core Experimental allows you to try out new features in advance, but exposes you to bugs that can cause CTDs and city corruption. We highly recommend testing this unstable version in a test region. Any bug reports should be made in [this thread](https://community.simtropolis.com/forums/topic/764056-colossus-addon-mod-core-experimental-support/).

    This mod is the main dependency for CAM Controllers.
    To install CAM, install a CAM Controller that depends on this package (see _Required By_).

    This package consists mainly of code and support files for UI, LText, and Exemplar.
    However, it does make many alterations to various Maxis default buildings that are designed for use with CAM,
    and also modifies Lua files affecting the Advisor system and other functionality of the game.

    This mod alerts the player when a water pump set to use fresh water and salt water is not working, allowing them to receive a warning.
    Also available is a cheat code `ScanPumps` that can be used as a debugging tool for modders.

    This mod cannot work without `pkg=cam:colossus-addon-mod-core`.
