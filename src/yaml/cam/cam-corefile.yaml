  description: |-
    This mod is the main dependency for CAM Controllers.
    To install CAM, install a CAM Controller that depends on this package (see _Required By_).

    This package consists mainly of code and support files for UI, LText, and Exemplar.
    However, it does make many alterations to various Maxis default buildings that are designed for use with CAM,
    and also modifies Lua files affecting the Advisor system and other functionality of the game.
