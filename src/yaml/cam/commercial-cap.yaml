  description: |-
     This patch increases the amount of demand cap relief provided by Real Highway neighborhood connections, so that they match Maxis Highways rather than the relatively low-priority Dirtroad network.

     The mod is compatible with CAM, SPAM and Vanilla games.

     A radical variant of the mod exists which additionally boosts cap relief provided by mass transit neighborhood connections (Rail, Subway, Elevated Rail, High-Speed Rail/Monorail) and punishes connections of water pipes and transmission lines (for balancing purposes).
