  description: |-
    Your edition of the game does not support DLL patches, so installing CAM 2.1 requires a _manual_ installation step.

    Sc4pac will only install the CAM files that go into your Plugins folder, but additionally, you need to manually patch the file `SimCity_1.dat` for use with CAM 2.1, if you haven't already.
    See the CAM 2.1 documentation on how to do this.
  values:
  - value: "manual"
    default: true

      **Important:** You need to manually patch the file `SimCity_1.dat` before proceeding.

info:
  summary: Colossus Addon Mod (CAM) Legacy Version 2.1
  warning: |-
    It is crucial to start a new region when first installing CAM, as the mod drastically changes the simulation parameters.

    This legacy version is only for compatibility support of already developed regions and for those who cannot upgrade to CAM 3.0 or later.
    If you are starting a new region and meet all the requirements for CAM 3.0 or later, install the current version of `pkg=cam:colossus-addon-mod` instead.

  conflicts: |-
    See the CAM manual for a list of mod incompatibilities.

  description: |
    The Colossus Addon Mod (CAM) is a big mod that drastically changes the way cities and regions develop.
    Most importantly, it adds new Growth Stages 9 to 15, beyond the game's default Stages 1 through 8.
    This leads to extended and more realistic gameplay, especially for the later phases of the game.

    To make the most of CAM, you will need to install a variety of CAM-patible buildings for the higher Growth Stages.

    This package installs the default "Extended" playstyle variant.

    This package is compatible with both Windows and macOS:

    * If your edition of the game supports DLL mods, the I-R fix is implemented using a DLL.
    * If your edition of the game does not support DLL mods, you will need to apply the I-R fix manually instead by patching the file `SimCity_1.dat`.

    Please consult the extensive CAM 2.1 documentation for further information.
