info:
  summary: Colossus Addon Mod (CAM) Legacy Version 2.1
  warning: |-
    It is crucial to start a new region when first installing CAM, as the mod drastically changes the simulation parameters.

    This legacy version is only for compatibility support of already developed regions and for those who cannot upgrade to CAM 3.0 or later.
    If you are starting a new region and meet all the requirements for CAM 3.0 or later, install `pkg=cam:colossus-addon-mod` instead.

  conflicts: |-
    Only compatible with game version 1.1.641, the Windows digital edition.
    See the CAM manual for a list of mod incompatibilities.

  description: |
    The Colossus Addon Mod (CAM) is a big mod that drastically changes the way cities and regions develop.
    Most importantly, it adds new Growth Stages 9 to 15, beyond the game's default Stages 1 through 8.
    This leads to extended and more realistic gameplay, especially for the later phases of the game.

    To make the most of CAM, you will need to install a variety of CAM-patible buildings for the higher Growth Stages.

    This package installs the default "Extended" playstyle variant.

    This package depends on the I-R fix.
    (This fix is now implemented using a DLL, so it is not necessary to modify any original game files.
    For game versions not supported by the DLL, you can install CAM with the I-R fix manually instead.)

    Please consult the extensive CAM documentation for further information.
