    # Colossus Addon Mod – CAM Controller

    The _Colossus Addon Mod (CAM)_ makes substantial changes to the way cities and regions develop.
    Most importantly, it adds new Growth Stages 9 to 15, beyond the game's default Stages 1 through 8.
    This leads to extended and more realistic gameplay, especially for the later phases of the game.
    Additionally, it includes several essential bugfixes developed by the community.

    To make the most of CAM, you will need to install a variety of CAM-patible buildings for the higher Growth Stages.

    ## Overview

    This version of the _CAM Controller_ introduces improvements to the educational simulation system and utility system, as well as changes to the Growth Stages, giving you:

    * 15 Residential Stages (8 Maxis Stages + 7 CAM Stages)
    * 15 Commercial Stages (8 Maxis Stages + 7 CAM Stages)
    * 10 Agricultural Stages (3 Maxis Stages + 7 CAM Stages)
    * 10 Industrial Stages (3 Maxis Stages + 7 CAM Stages)

    The changes implemented in the RCI simulation will give players greater emphasis on planning in regional development, rather than just on individual cities.

    In addition, this controller is compatible with **CAMeLot** lots, which use the additional stages introduced by CAM.

    ## MIGRATION

    Migration to CAM 3.0 and later versions **can** be done if you meet these requirements:

    * ✅ Players coming from CAM 2.5 can upgrade to this version of CAM.
    * ✅ Players coming from CAM 2.1 (Legacy Version) can upgrade this version of CAM if they used the _Extended Playstyle_ option.
    * ✅ Players from Vanilla must create a new region before switching to this version of CAM.

    Migration to CAM 3.0 and later versions **cannot** be done if you meet these conditions:

    * ❌ Players from SPAM (Legacy Version) cannot switch to this version of CAM.
    * ❌ Players from Vanilla cannot switch to this version of CAM if using it in an already developed region.
    * ❌ Players coming from CAM 3.0 with the _CAM-SPAM Controller_ cannot switch to this variant of CAM, and vice-versa.
