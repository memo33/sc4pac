  description: |-
    **Colossus Addon Mod - CAM Controller** is the popular SimCity 4 mod that involves substantial changes in the RCI (Residential - Commercial - Industrial) simulation as well as essential bugfixes. The mod was developed by the various members of the CAM Team who over time have brought modifications to improve this mod

    CAM Controller introduces improvements to the educational simulation system and utility, as well as changes to the stage system, giving you:

    * 15 Residential Stages (8 Maxis Stages + 7 CAM Stages)
    * 15 Commercial Stages (8 Maxis Stages + 7 CAM Stages)
    * 10 Agricultural Stages (3 Maxis Stages + 7 CAM Stages)
    * 10 Industrial Stages (3 Maxis Stages + 7 CAM Stages)

    The changes implemented in the RCI simulation will give players greater emphasis and planning in regional development, rather than just on individual cities.

    In addition, this controller is compatible with **CAMeLot** lots because these lots use the additional stages introduced by CAM.

    Please note that this pack may receive updates in the near future. Do not redistribute without asking first, mostly as doing so would complicate efforts to properly maintain, update, and provide technical support for the pack.

    ***WARNING: From version 2.5 onward Colossus Addon Mod works only with the digital version (1.1.641) of SimCity 4 (Microsoft Windows and Linux only). If you run CAM 2.5 or later on systems different from those listed, the mod may malfunction and no support is provided***

    * Players from SPAM (Legacy Version) cannot switch to CAM 3.0 using only the CAM Controller.
    * Players from vanilla cannot switch to CAM 3.0 if it is used in a developed region
