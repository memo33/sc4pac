    **Colossus Addon Mod - CAM Controller** is the popular SimCity 4 mod that involves substantial changes in the RCI (Residential - Commercial - Industrial) simulation as well as essential bugfixes. The mod was developed by the various members of the CAM Team who over time have brought modifications to improve this mod

    Please note that this pack may receive updates in the near future. Do not redistribute without asking first, mostly as doing so would complicate efforts to properly maintain, update, and provide technical support for the pack.

    Extra feature, if you hover over the folders in the installer, you will get some extra information about each contents

    WARNING: From version 2.5 onward Colossus Addon Mod works only with the digital version (1.1.641) of SimCity 4 (Microsfot Windows and Linux only). If you run CAM 2.5 or later on systems different from those listed, the mod may malfunction and no support is provided
    MIGRATION:

    Migration to CAM 3.0 and later versions can be done if you meet these requirements

    * Players coming from CAM 2.5 can upgrade to CAM 3.0 using only the CAM Controller
    * Players from vanilla can switch to CAM 3.0 using the CAM Controller but must create a new region

    Migration to CAM 3.0 and later versions cannot be done if you meet these requirements

    * Players coming from CAM 2.1.1 cannot upgrade to CAM 3.0 
    * Players from SPAM cannot switch to CAM 3.0 using only the CAM Controller.
    * Players from vanilla cannot switch to CAM 3.0 if it is used in a developed region
    * Players coming from CAM 3.0 with the CAM-SPAM Controller cannot switch to CAM 3.0 - CAM Controller
    * Players coming from CAM 3.0 with the CAM Controller cannot switch to CAM 3.0 CAM-SPAM Controller

    If you are installing CAM starting from these given directions it is discouraged not to use the already developed regions as you may experience compatibility problems with edphics, problems with RCI simualtion so it is strongly advised to create a new region to avoid the problems.
    Installation

    This package is a simple .zip file. Just extract the a_CAM folder to your My Documents/SimCity 4/Plugins directory (or equivalent, if you have a custom Plugins folder location).

    It is highly recommended to run the cleanitol with the installer and remove any previous versions from your plugins.
    Optionally in the ~Documents folder in the main ZIP you can find a collective/master and by using either the newer nos.17's SC4 Cleanitol or the older BSC Cleanitol tool you can search and remove old and outdated versions of these files.
