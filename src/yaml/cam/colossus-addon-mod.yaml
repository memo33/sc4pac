  description: |
    The Colossus Addon Mod (CAM) is a big mod that drastically changes the way cities and regions develop.
    Most importantly, it adds new Growth Stages 9 to 15, beyond the game's default Stages 1 through 8.
    This leads to extended and more realistic gameplay, especially for the later phases of the game.

    To make the most of CAM, you will need to install a variety of CAM-patible buildings for the higher Growth Stages.

    This package installs the default "Extended" playstyle variant.

    This package depends on the I-R fix.
    (This fix is now implemented using a DLL, so it is not necessary to modify any original game files.
    For game versions not supported by the DLL, you can install CAM with the I-R fix manually instead.)

    Please consult the extensive CAM documentation for further information.
