    **Colossus Addon Mod - SPAM Controller** is the updated and improved version of SPAM that allows you to fix agricultural demand without altering the RCI simulation and enjoy the CAM enhancements The mod was developed by the various members of the CAM Team who over time have brought modifications to improve this mod
    
    CAM - SPAM Controller introduces improvements to the educational and utility simulation system, as well as changes to the stage system, giving you:

    * 8 Residential Stages (8 Maxis Stages)
    * 8 Commercial Stages (8 Maxis Stages)
    * 6 Agricultural Stages (3 Maxis Stages + 3 CAM - SPAM Stages)
    * 3 Industrial Stages (3 Maxis Stages)

    The changes implemented will allow players to enjoy a vanilla experience in regional and city development, while also allowing them to build rural environments with an existing agricultural demand that is not eliminated when the city grows
    
    This controller does not contain any farm batches, so it requires you to download compatible third-party content.

    Furthermore, this content is only compatible with CAMeLot Agriculture lots, but only for stages 4, 5, and 6.

    ***WARNING: From version 2.5 onward Colossus Addon Mod works only with the digital version (1.1.641) of SimCity 4 (Microsfot Windows and Linux only). If you run CAM 2.5 or later on systems different from those listed, the mod may malfunction and no support is provided***
