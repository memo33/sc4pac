  summary: "Gizmo - Effect Props"
  description: |-
    Contains over 50 new effects able to be added to lots as props. The effects are set up to repeat as soon as they are done. Don't add too many effects to one lot as some sluggishness may occur.

    Note that some of these effects are destructive, meaning that when they go off they will blow up the lot containing them. These effects have "destructive" in their name. Please remember this when you make lots to pass around and put a warning on a lot if you add the destructive effect.
