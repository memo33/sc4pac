  summary: Vehicle Props
  description: |-
    This package adds all the default UDI vehicles as props.

    The older, but still used **Vehicle\_Props-V3.dat** file, as a dependency for many contents all over the exchanges has been merged with the later recommended **Vehicle Props v4.0.dat** and now they form the **Vehicle Props v5.0.dat**. Bear in mind that these props are the very same apart from the Instance IDs.
