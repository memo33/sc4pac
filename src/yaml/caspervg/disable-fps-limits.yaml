  description: |

    This DLL plugin for SimCity 4 disables the default FPS (frames per second) limitations during simulation speeds. By default, SimCity 4 imposes the following FPS limits:

    * Turtle speed (slow simulation): 30 FPS
    * Rhino speed (medium simulation): 20 FPS
    * Cheetah speed (fast simulation): 15 FPS

    This DLL removes these limitations, allowing the game to run at higher frame rates (up to 255 FPS) during all simulation speeds.

    Previously this DLL mod was only available on GitHub and in a file attachment on SC4Evermore. This version has now been updated with a bit more configurability, better logging and a more modern build system. If you already had this mod installed, you can replace it with this one. 
  warning: |-
    This DLL plugin comes with an INI configuration file:

    * `SC4DisableFpsLimits.ini`

    To complete the installation, copy this file from the package subfolder into the root directory of your Plugins folder and edit the file to set your preferences.
