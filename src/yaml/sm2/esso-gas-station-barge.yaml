  summary: Esso Gas Station Barge
  description: |-
    Gas stations are not limited to land only. There are Floating fuel barges around the Great Lakes and large rivers around the world.

    This one is the Esso version. Plop it on sea water, rivers or lakes. Close to a marina or anywhere where one would look nice in your maps.

     - Lot size: 1X1 (actual model length is 3 tiles by 1)
     - Plop cost: 1000
     - Power generated: 100 (no need to bring power to it in order to see the beautiful night lights)
     - Maintenance cost: 10

    You will find it in your Seaport menu.

    Bonus, it also acts as a power plant therefore it could provide power to other water based lots that require electricity by plopping it near by.
