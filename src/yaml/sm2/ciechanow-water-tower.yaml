  summary: Ciechanow Water Tower
  description: |-
    This water tower actually still exists in Ciechanow, Poland. It was built in 1972 but it is in disuse now.

    With its amazing hyperbole and toroid design it attracts many tourists to that town

    Simple to use, just plop it and connect the water network to it.

     - Lot size: 2x2.
     - Needs power to run.
     - Produces 45,000m3 of water per month.

     You will find it in your water utilities menu.

     Both the new and old towers are included. The choice is up to you to plop whichever one you like.
