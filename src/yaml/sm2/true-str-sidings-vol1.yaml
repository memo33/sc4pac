  summary: True STR Sidings Vol1
  description: |-
    Sidings are used mostly as a parking spot for trains and they are found practically in any nation that has a rail network.

    This pack consist of 12 different STR sidings. They are from 16 to 22 tiles long! Made with dozens of proprietary train props families for maximum diversity.

    Every time you plop one it will have different railcars showing on the lot so that even if you plop them side by side they will look different.

    There are also a custom rail design overlay therefore almost all of them have different rail design.  
    They will connect to your RRW STR network and both your freight and passenger trains will run through them.
