  summary: Trash Barge A
  description: |-
    Plop it on water. For very large cities you may plop several and watch the garbage disappear.  
    You can even plop it on a small lake if you wish.

     - Plop cost: 7000
     - Bulldoze cost: 700
     - Power req: 0
     - Water req: 0
     - Trash shipped 25000 tons monthly
     - Monthly maintenance: 100

    This lot is not animated. It just represents a simple trash barge hauling garbage but it does not move, however it still functions as a recycling center.

    You will find it under the garbage menu.
