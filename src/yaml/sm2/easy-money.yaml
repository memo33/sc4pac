  description: |-
    This is a developer money lot. It gives 10 million Simoleons every time you plop it.

    To get another 10 million Simoleons just bulldoze this lot and re-plop it. Simple and effective.

    It is useful when plopping experimental lots that costs more money than the game initial 500k  
    Perfect for those players that likes to plop anything they want for that perfect CJ.

    You will find it in your park menu.

    Don't spend it all in one place!!
