  summary: RRW HD Rail Bumpers
  description: |-
    This mod replaces both the US and EU railways stub bumpers with a custom HD universal one.

    Both Orthogonal and diagonal DTR and STR are affected. If you already have end stubs drawn in your maps, you only need to touch it with the rail tool to make it change to the new set.
