  summary: Limington Station
  description: |-
    A fictional rural train station for all your farming maps (It can be used everywhere though)

    This is a proximity station, you only need to plop it next to either a DTR or STR network. It will also work with your vanilla Maxis rail.  
    Because it is a proximity station it is not bound by either freight nor passenger train limitations. Both will happily pass by the station but only the passenger trains will be counted against the station capacity.

     - Lot size: 3X1
     - Plop cost: 1500
     - Bulldoze cost: 200
     - Power req: 4
     - Water req: 2
     - Station capacity: 27500
