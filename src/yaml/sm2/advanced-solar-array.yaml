  summary: Advanced Solar Array
  description: |-
    A futuristic solar energy converter that generates electricity. During the night or in the case of high winds it will automatically retract underground in order to avoid damage.

    This particular lot is made up of 12 different timed models which gives the lot a somewhat animated feel.  
    The entire sequence will occur within the 24 hours day/night game period.

    The best way to plop this lot is in a staggered fashion because when the solar panels are fully deployed it will cross the lot boundaries and may touch the other array adjacent to this one. Nothing will happen but for that short duration it wont look so good. They can be plopped anywhere, no road/streets necessary.  
    If they are plopped in a remote location you may need to use the game power pylons in order to bring electricity to where it is necessary.

    Game lag may cause 2 models to appear at the same time. Give it a few minutes and it will fix itself.

     - Bulldoze cost: 250
     - Power req: 1
     - Water req: 0
