    This package introduce a wider variety of sand colors and textures.

    8 new colors and textures in 2 sizes. Large and small.  
    As a bonus twigs, tiny rocks and branches MMP are also included, named SM2 Beach Clutter.  
    Also as an extra bonus a nifty little wrecked boat was added that can be used either above or under water.

    For a grand total of 18 separate MMPs!

    All models are in HD, they are slope conforming and will also plop underwater.

    (When plopping MMPs under water you may not see it plop immediately, if thats the case, please zoom out then in or rotate view and the MMPs will appear correctly)

    Make sandy paths, beach scenes, mountain scene, lakes scene, construction scenes etc.

    Making a coal mine lot? No problem! You now have black sand which can simulate coal bits and dust! Your imagination is your limit.

    You will find them all under your Mayor menu.
