    You will find 3 lots in this pack.

     1. The main one is 19X15 and will provide 496 I-M jobs.  
     2. D1 (big blades depot) is 9x4 and will provide 3 jobs.  
     3. D2 (small blades depot) is 5x4 and will provide 3 jobs.

    The large lot has a DTR rail which can be connected to the rail network (RRW). The lot will allow both freight and passenger train to go through for maximum realism. You can expand the main lot by plopping extra depots around its perimeter or you can plop them separately, up to you.

    All 3 lots make extensive usage of timed prop families and you can find them in the Landmark menu.  
    Actions starts at 6AM and goes around the clock.
