  summary: Old Fortresses
  description: |-
    You will find 2 differently textured models in this pack. Use one or both as you wish.

    This is an old fortress loosely based on one in Quebec.

    The whole model fits on a 1x1 lot with no base texture, please flatten terrain before placement.

    Extensive usage of MMP is required for best visual results.

     - Cost to plop: 25000
     - No power, water or monthly maintenance are necessary.

    Also, these lots do not require a road connection. An MMP one, made to your taste, will do.

    You will find them in the park menu.
