  summary: Scrap Metal Transfer Station
  description: |-
    This is a local scrap metal transfer station, where anything metal starts its journey before reaching a proper processing center.

    There used to be a lot of them in the past. Metal is collected and then transported to facilities such as these. It is then loaded onto railcars to be transported to a proper processing center where is then crunched into smaller pieces or compressed into blocks.

    Finally it is brought to a smelting center to be transformed into new metal items, just to start the cycle again.

    Each unit serves up to 50,000 people at 50% recycling reduction.

    You will find it under the utility menu.

     - Lot size: 8X5
     - Plop cost: 15,000
     - Power used: 36
     - Water used: 90

    Lots of timed props where used to make this lot somewhat animated. Action starts at 7am and goes on till closing time at 6pm.

    Due to game lag, you may experience props overlapping. Its not an issue. Wait a bit and it will correct itself.

    RRW DTR rail will connect to this lot visually only therefore it will have to be on a rail spur, not the main line.
