  summary: Deepwater Oil Terminal
  description: |-
    A deep water oil terminal is a floating platform with a pumping station and all the equipment needed to fillup or empty an oil tanker ship.

    The idea behind it is to avoid an ecological disaster too close to shore in case of an accident.

    They can be 20-30 miles away from the coast in some cases. Oil is pumped from shore to the platform through the usage of large pipes laid on the bottom of the sea.

    This lot is 1x1 overhanging.

    Once plopped you can then plop ships near it to simulate the scenario. Placement of a ship near it can be tricky in some cases due to the different sea levels.

    You may need to plop the ship a few times before perfect placement.

    On the other hand you could plop the ship first and then try to plop this platform.  
    I have set the plop cost of the platform at a mere 100 so as not to drain the walled due to the need to plop it several times to get it right.

    It also generates its own power for the night light thus there is no need to bring power to it  
    You will find it in the seaport menu.
