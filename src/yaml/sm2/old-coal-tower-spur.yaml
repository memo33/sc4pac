  summary: Old Coal Tower Spur
  description: |-
    This is an old rail spur, used extensively during the coal era. There are quite a few dotted along the railway network but they are abandoned.  
    An old coal tower can still be seen including a very rusty and decrepit outbuilding.

    This lot features Real 3d Rails (not flat textures) for an even greater realism!

    3 pieces make up the ensemble:

     - One 1x1 Transition piece between RRW STR and Real 3d Rails.
     - One 1x1 Real 3d Rail extension piece, which allows you to extend the length of the ensemble.
     - One 7x3 main lot with the scene itself.

    Plop cost: 4000

    It gives some landmark effect.

    No power,water and road connections necessary thus allowing you to plop this in any remote location you wish.

    You will find them in the landmark menu
