  summary: Breakwater Concrete Blocks
  description: |-
    Concrete breakwater blocks have been used for a long time to diminish the force of impact from the awesome power of sea waves.

    You will find them around port areas and around important sea facilities such as refineries and other such structures.

    If you use dark water textures it is suggested to lift the water floor to 7.5 meter depth. You will then be able to see the blocks under water!!
