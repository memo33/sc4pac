  summary: Center Pivot Irrigation Fields
  description: |-
    Center pivot irrigation fields are still widely used all over the world. This one is model based and it changes 4 times a year following the seasons therefore its considered a seasonal lot.

    The lot is 1x1 and covers a 9x9 game grid. The usage of MMP around the field is advised so as to make it blend better.

    When you plop it you may get an empty tile at first, it may take time for it to sync with the game clock. Be patient.

    The lot is completely neutral and it also needs no adjacent road therefore it can be plopped anywhere on the map as long as you pick a flat spot.

    You will find it in your Park Menu.
