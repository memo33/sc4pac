  summary: Marine Wind Power
  description: |-
    You will find 2 lots in this pack
      
     1. The Wind Turbine is to be plopped on water.
     2. The buoy is to be plopped on water, from the Wind Turbine field to the shore.
      
    The buoy acts as a power transmission lot. It will light up at night if powered. Turn on your power grid and plop the buoys in a row. Watch the green power grid make the connection. Once satisfied, turn the power grid off.
      
    Each Wind Turbine will output 1800 units of power. By plopping a few of them you can enjoy unlimited green power!!
    
    A specific Power Substation can be found in `pkg=sm2:power-pack`. Plop it on shore for a seamless power grid.
