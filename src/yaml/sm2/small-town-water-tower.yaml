  summary: Small Town Water Tower
  description: |-
    Just a simple 1x1 lot with a steel water tower, perfect for those small towns that dot a farming map.  
    You can obviously use it in any map if you so wish.

    Stats

     - Lot size: 1x1
     - Plop cost: 2500
     - Bulldoze cost: 100
     - Water produced 4500
     - Monthly maintenance: 100

    This lot has no base texture. plop it as is on any terrain or use MMP's to create your own base.
