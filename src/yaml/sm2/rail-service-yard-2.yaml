  summary: Rail Service Yard 2
  description: |-
    This rail yard is a tad older than `pkg=sm2:rail-service-yard-1`, there is even an old abandoned steam locomotive sitting in a corner just rusting away. Also you can see the rail tracks are really old as well.
    Train cars will come and go throughout the day as will workers. The base of this lot was repaved a few years ago with 3/4 inch crushed limestone when the economy had an uptick due to a local factory re-opening for business.

    Both passenger and freight trains will pass through the lot and like Yard 1, it is not a freight yard but a holding place for trains and it acts as a small repair facility for minor issues.

    It also provides 38 jobs.
