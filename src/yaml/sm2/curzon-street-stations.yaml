  summary: Curzon Street Stations
  description: |-
    Based on a real station in Birmingham UK. Opened in 1838 and finally closed in 1966.  
    The building still exists today and there are plans to revitalize it once more in the near future.

    This project includes 2 stations. A 7x2 terminus and a 2x2 proximity lot.

    The terminus capacity is 47500  
    The proximity lot capacity is 32500

    With the proximity lot you can draw a rail line along any of the 4 sides and it will still work as intended, just make sure you have a road/street touch the lot as well so that pedestrians, buses and cars can reach it.

    **SM2 Curzon Station Small**  
     - Lot size: 2x2  
     - Power req 8  
     - Water req: 11  
     - Cost to plop: 2500  
     - Bulldoze cost: 250

    The terminus only requires you to connect 2 DTR lines on one end. It also acts as a parking lot and a bus station.
