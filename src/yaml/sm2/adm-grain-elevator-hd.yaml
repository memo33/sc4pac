  summary: ADM Grain Elevator HD
  description: |-
    Grain Elevators are allover the place, they are used to collect, store and ship mostly wheat grains. This one is a truly colossal model based on a real life structure found in Alberta, Canada.

    This is the HD version of `pkg=sm2:adm-grain-elevator-sd`. It is rendered without the silos, which are added as props to the lot.

    This elevator also acts as a freight yard.

    The dirt roads and STR rail will connect to the game networks visually therefore you will see freight trucks arriving and freight trains leaving.

     - Lot size: 7x5
     - Freight capacity: 23,800 tons
     - Jobs: 37 low, 17 med and 3 high
     - Plop cost: 4250
     - Power: 15
     - Water: 56
