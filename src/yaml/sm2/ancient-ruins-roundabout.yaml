  summary: Ancient Ruins Roundabout
  description: |-
    These ancient ruins were made by someone deep in the well of time. There are many speculations as to its function, some say that human sacrifice were made within its stony walls and others say that it is an astronomical tool built to follow the stars.

    Today it stands there, solitary and well maintained by the current city staff, while traffic from a bustling metropolis moves by it. Sometimes people that identify with the ancients, conduct ceremonies there.
    Generations go by and the stones just sit there, unchanged, immutable and immortal.

    This Roundabout will replace the one that comes with the NAM avenue, just bulldoze the fountain in the middle and plop this and you are done.

    It will provide a small residential CAP relief.
    Requires no power, just a little water to keep the grass green.
    And its good for the environment due to the park effect.
