  summary: Concrete Sound Barriers
  description: |-
    With 41 pieces at your disposal you can bet that just about any combination has been covered!
    This set includes several FA3 (Fractional Angle 18.4 deg.) pieces for those special angled projects.

    Orthogonal, 45 deg, FA3, exit doors, emergency phone, ortho to 45, ortho to FA3, end pieces, overhanging ones, 11 with graffiti plus a double length one and one special Orthogonal piece that you can plop on slopes of up to 45 deg.

    To recap, 40 lots can only be places on fairly flat terrain and one flex piece for up to 45 degrees inclines.

    The lots are provided with no base or overlay textures therefore you can dress them with your favorite MMPs.

    ALL lots are neutral but one, the TEL piece. This is the only one with nightlights.

    Use them on your highways, roads, railways and they also look great as fences in between industries and residential.
