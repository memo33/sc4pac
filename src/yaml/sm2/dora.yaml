  summary: Dora
  description: |-
    Sister to Gustav, the most powerful mobile cannons built during WWII.

    These beasts where so heavy that they had to build a dual rail line with a super reinforced base just to move them a few miles. They no longer exist because they were destroyed at the end of the conflict.

    This lot is merely a military display and the only thing it will fire is its keeper for not cleaning the site properly !

     - Lot size: 4X3
     - Cost to plop: 10000
     - Residential cap relief 6000 across all 3 levels.
     - Needs a bit of power and water to function.

    You will find it in the park menu.

    Lest we forget!
