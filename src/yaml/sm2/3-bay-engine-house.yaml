  summary: 3 Bay Engine House
  description: |-
    A small 3 bay rail engine house where locomotives go for small repairs.

    Compact design so it can fit in tight places. Place it on a spur, not on the main rail line.

    The lot requires road access in order for the sims to go to work there.

    The locomotives are in a family therefore you will get different liveries every time you plop the lot. A few other props are also in families.

     - Provides $$25 jobs
     - Lot size: 10x2
     - Plop cost: 6500
     - Bulldoze cost: 950
     - Power req: 10
     - Water req: 10

    As usual, custom textures included.

    You will find it under the rail menu.
