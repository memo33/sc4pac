  summary: Aqueduct
  description: |-
    With a total of 36 pieces, this set, was made to satisfy even the most demanding of players. Bridges over rails, roads, streets, avenues, highways, ravines and even rivers as wide as 6 tiles. Curves, diagonals, pump houses, in ground, valves and elevation transitions, making this the perfect set for all your projects.

    All bridges are overhanging therefore you can have any network you wish, run under them with no issues at all. It's called the SM2 Aqueduct (Water pipes) they are 2 meters in diameter with no markings, therefore you can use them for whatever industry you like, natural gas, water, oil etc. making them very flexible.

    All 36 pieces were carefully made to match, they are also super MMP friendly and have no base textures.

    Only one piece will require electricity, the rail piece. The rest are neutral lots with a slight park effect.

    No cost to plop, bulldoze or maintain, easy on the wallet, easy on the eye. You will find all lots in the park menu and the MML, if you wish to use it, will be in the landmark menu.

    Usage.

    Make sure you flatten the pipe path for perfect connections. The river/land spans lots are based on the 15 meter rule (height) that means that if you start at sea level you can go up to any elevation but in 15 meters increments. The land bridges work best on flat surface.
    The river pylons can be placed on water deeper than 15 meters but no less than.

    So if you place a river or land span your must plop the bridge on a 15 meter elevation in order to have a seamless pylon to bridge connection.

    The possible combinations you can achieve are enormous, your imagination is your limit!
