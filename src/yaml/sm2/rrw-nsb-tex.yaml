    Ever wanted to place just the rails on a concrete surface?  
    Well, with 414 pieces at your disposal, now you can.

    PIMX and LE users rejoice!

    This RRW compatible sleeper-less and ballast-less texture set is made to be used on concrete, asphalt, brick and stone surfaces.  
    I have covered almost every possible rail configuration. I left out some that would not be suitable to place on lots.

    Included with this pack is a comprehensive jpeg collection of some of the possible configurations to get you started.  
    **Remember that you can flip, mirror and rotate** the tiles for even more possibilities. Your imagination is the limit.
