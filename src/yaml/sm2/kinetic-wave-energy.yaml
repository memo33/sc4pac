  summary: Kinetic Wave Energy
  description: |-
    This is based on a real machine. Its actually being installed in many places around the world to complement wind powered turbines.

    It works by harnessing the awesome power of sea waves, a never ending source of kinetic energy. All green renewable energy.

    It plops entirely on water. This pack includes a special made buoy which will be needed to bring the power to shore. Turn on your power view and plop the buoy every 5 tiles. You will see the power being transferred by watching the green tiles light up.

    Use SM2's power pack lots to simulate a transformer station on shore. Follow the instructions on that pack for best visual results.

     - Cost to plop: 40000
     - Power produced: 6000
     - Power buoy plop cost: 10
     - Life expectancy: 100 years at full production.

    Find it under the power menu
