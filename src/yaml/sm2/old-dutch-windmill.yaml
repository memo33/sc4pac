  summary: Old Dutch Windmill
  description: |-
    Just a simple model of an old stone windmill.

    It is not animated but its rendered in HD.

    1x1 lot, completely neutral and you will find it in your park menu.

    Requires no road access also no power or electricity.

    Costs nothing to plop or bulldoze and has zero monthly requirements.

    The lot has no base texture, just use some MMP and your imagination.
