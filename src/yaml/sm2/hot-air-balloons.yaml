  summary: Hot Air Balloons
  description: |-
    6 different hot air balloons to embellish you maps.

    They have no base texture therefore the lots can be disguised as anything. Leave it plain or use mmp to dress the lots to match whatever background you have.

    Each one gives 250 R$-R$$-R$$$ relief and some park effect, also no power or water is required.

     - Cost to plop: 100
     - Monthly fee: 10

    You will find them in the park menu.

    Balloons heights differ from 40 meters to 250 meters.

    They can be plopped on slopes and even on water so as to create ocean scenes.
