info:
  summary: Activates and fixes all three City Hall lots (Modpacc Zero)
  description: |-
    This mod combines various fixes for the Maxis City Hall.
    It also enables the later City Hall lots, Phases 2 and 3, unlockable as reward â€“ which Maxis planned for, but never activated.

    Additionally, the mod adds a small Village Hall lot.

    (The optional fluff news remover and query sound remover are not included in this package.)
  conflicts: |-
    Compatible with `pkg=simmaster07:upgradeable-city-halls-dll`,
    but incompatible with both the City Hall fix by Andreas and the one by MrTruesage.
