  summary: "Provides detailed stats about city growth"
  description: |
    This is the non-DLL version of the Census Repository.

    The Census Repository's query provides detailed information about the
    city's residential, commercial and industrial supply, demand and CAPs.
    Additional information shown includes vacant houses, unemployment,
    commuters, taxes and educational quotient, all important factors when
    analysing a city's growth. By hovering above any piece of information in
    the query, you will get more explanations.

    The Census Repository consists of two lots: the Vault and the Facility.

    The Census Repository Vault is meant for rural towns and other locations
    where you want to encourage agricultural growth. It is cheaper to plop and
    cheaper to run, and employs only 5 over-working clerks.

    The Census Repository Facility isn't available in every city. You need to
    have a situation where you must soon provide CAP relief in order to keep
    your city growing. It needs to be plopped across a busy road in a
    commercial area. It boosts commercial growth but you don't want to live too
    close to it. It is more expensive to plop and to run than the Vault, as it
    employs up to 85 clerks. However, you will get income from sims who love to
    drive under the glass corridors of this formidable formicarium.

    For compatibility with all traffic simulators, this package installs the
    Ultra variant of the Census Repository Facility.

    Consult the Readme file for detailed information.
