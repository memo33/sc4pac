  summary: "Third-party patches for SC4"
  conflicts: "Incompatible with the macOS version of the game."
  description: >
    Fixes a serialization bug that could corrupt the savegame, particularly when mods are installed that modify existing exemplars (i.e. Prop Pox).

    Resolves a crash-to-desktop when hovering NAM puzzle pieces over transit-enabled lots.

    Allows other DLLs to load into SC4's memory without a GZCOM framework.
