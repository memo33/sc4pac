    Note: this terrain mod provides a variety of terrain controller configurations,
    which allow customization of elevation, snow, and erosion properties.
    This package installs only the basic version.  If you want more control,
    it's necessary to install the mod manually.

    This is an HD terrain mod which requires the use of hardware rendering mode.
