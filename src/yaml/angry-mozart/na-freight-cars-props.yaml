  description: |
    Today, intermodal freight transport is the most popular way to transport products all around the world. This is not a surprise when it comes to a mode of transportation that can be shipped by road, rail or ship without opening the container, reducing time and cost. In North America exist two types of intermodal: International Intermodal and Domestic Intermodal.

    International Intermodal: In international intermodal (figure 4), containers are standardized by international rules (ISO), making it possible to load a container on a truck, train or ship anywhere in the world. International intermodal uses 20 ft, 40 ft and 45 ft containers.

    Domestic Intermodal: In domestic intermodal (figure 5), containers are shipped only trough the US, Mexico and Canada. This makes possible the loading of longer containers (28 ft, 48 ft, 53 ft). Also, trailers can be loaded on special flat cars, (Trailer On Flat Car or TOFC), reducing cost in transportation and time. In this pack, you will find:
      • 40 ft Wellcar A car that can haul containers of maximum length of 40 ft.
      • 53 ft Wellcar: A car that can haul containers of maximum length of 53 ft.
      • 40 ft Container: A container used for international intermodal.
      • 45 ft Container: Another container used for international intermodal.
      • 53 ft Container: A container used for domestic intermodal.
      • 89 ft TOFC Flat Car: A flat car usually loaded with trailers.
      • 45 ft Dry van: A dry van trailer.
      • 53 ft Dry van: Another dry van trailer.
