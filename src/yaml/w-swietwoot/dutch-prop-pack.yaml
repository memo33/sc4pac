  description: |
    This is a Dutch themed prop pack. About 100 props, including colour variations and diagonals. You can give your lots or modds a Dutch theme with these. Various stuff like trash cans, paid-parking machines, glass recycle containers and phone booths. I guess the pictures speak for themselves.I intended them to be used in shopping centres, parks, plaza's, parkings, highways, roads, street-modds, busstops, bicycle-paths, rest-area's or residential-lots. Maybe you will even find a different use for them.All models are made by me, and all are in HD. Only a couple of decals are from the internet.Dependencies:None, this is a proppack and can be used as a dependency itself.Installation:Just copy the Was_NL_Props_Vol01.dat file to your plugins folder.For uninstalling, just delete the file again. This file is dorment in your plugins folder unless you explicitly start using it, by modding or lotting. Feel free to make lots or modds with these and upload your work. But there is no need to actually include this file, just list it as a dependency.Well, if anything is wrong with the files in the upload, just leave a comment here or PM me. For more info on my stuff you can also visit here: http://sc4devotion.c...p?topic=14229.0*** version 1.1 has zoom 3 errors fixed. These errors affected 7 props ***Enjoy!
