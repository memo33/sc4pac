  summary: Fixes unintentional occurrences of non-Maxis flora appearing on the City Hall lot
  description: |-
    Custom trees or other objects may appear in front of the in-game city hall when you have custom mayor mode tree mods installed. Some of these items use the same ID as certain in-game flora props. This mod removes these flora props and replaces them with two standard maple trees. To fix the issue, bulldoze existing city halls placed in your city, install this mod, and rebuild the city hall afterwards.
