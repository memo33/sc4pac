  summary: NYC Housing Projects Set 3
  description: |-
    There are six growable residential lots included in this set- each lot is named after (but does not necessarily resemble) a real housing project in New York City.
    Each lot has a different arrangement of housing blocks; thus all the lots have different stats.
    The lots are CAMpatible but do not require the CAM to grow.
    They will only grow on high-density residential zones- it helps to hold down the CTRL key when zoning areas large enough for these lots.
