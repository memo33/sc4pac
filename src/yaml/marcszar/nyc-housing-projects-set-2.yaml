  summary: NYC Housing Projects Set 2
  description: |-
    There are fifteen growable residential lots included in this set- each lot is named after a real housing project in New York City.
    Each lot has a different arrangement of housing blocks; thus all the lots have different stats.
    The stage 6, 7, and 8 lots are CAMpatible (but do not require the CAM) and the stage 9 and 10 lots are CAMeLOTs (they require the CAM).
    The lots will only grow on high-density residential zones- it helps to hold down the CTRL key when zoning areas large enough for these lots.
