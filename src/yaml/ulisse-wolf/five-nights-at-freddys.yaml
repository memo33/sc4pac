  summary: "Freddy Fazbear's pizza restaurant (CS$$)"
  description: >
    This Halloween-themed package contains a pizza restaurant as a Stage 2 growable CS$$ lot as well as a ploppable landmark on a 6Ã—6 lot.

    The building is inspired by Five Nights at Freddy's and has been modded to include strange events and brutal murders by cute animatronics during the night.
