  summary: CDK-REC Seawall Kit Vol 1
  description: |
    Although this file was intended primarily as a dependency for future PEG-CDK REC lots, it can also be used by lot developers to create their own CDK styled lots.
    The official CDK REC lots use single piece, custom foundation props for each lot which are fixed in size to the specific lot and are largely not re-useable.
    However, the basic seawall has now been broken down in to its basic components and re-created as individual prop pieces that you can assemble in the Lot Editor.
