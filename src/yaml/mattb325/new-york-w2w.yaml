  summary: Ten W2W buildings from New York City
  description: >
    This Wall-to-Wall pack consists of real buildings from around the Noho and Soho districts that take in a large variety of architectural styles.
    In addition to being taller mid-rise buildings which are great for busy city street scenes, these buildings are mostly all corner buildings.

    Some of the buildings not only grow as Commercial, but also as Residential buildings.
    They grow on lot sizes 1×1, 1×2 and 2×2 for medium and high-density zones with the New York tileset.
