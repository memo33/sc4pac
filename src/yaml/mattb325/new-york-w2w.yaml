  summary: New York W2W Pack
  description: >
    A set containing ten Wall to Wall (W2W) buildings from New York City.
    These are all real buildings from around the Noho and Soho districts and take in a large variety of architectural styles.
    In addition to being taller mid-rise buildings which are great for busy city street scenes, these buildings are mostly all corner buildings.
