  summary: Cruise Ship Terminal
  description: >
    Using the cruise ship terminal helps to break through demand caps, increase mayor and landmark ratings, and provides jobs; all of these enable you to get a thriving high end commercial services sector and enable a higher populations of R$$ and R$$$ sims.
    This is crucial to helping build large cities.

    In real life, most cruise ship terminals are fairly swank affairs as, just like airports, they are often the first impression a visitor has of a city.
    This cruise ship building is modded similarly to the in-game version and there are also custom made seawalls for the lot.
    Like the ingame version, it is found in the rewards menu and provides jobs once plopped.
    It therefore needs road access.

    Unlike the ingame version, it does not require certain thresholds to be met before being unlocked, and it can also be placed more than once in the same city.
    It does NOT replace the Maxis version and you can have both co-exist in the same city if you wish.
    The lot size is a more realistic and substantial 7 tiles wide by 5 tiles deep.
