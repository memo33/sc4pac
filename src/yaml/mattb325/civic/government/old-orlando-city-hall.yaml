  summary: "Old Orlando City Hall"
  description: >
    This 8-floor building with two asymmetrical balanced lower wings is typical
    of many mid-century public American buildings.  They were solidly built with
    quality materials: limestone, marble and pink granite.

    This building is offered as a non-conditional town hall reward.
    It provides 986 civic jobs and has all of the benefits (commercial and residential boost)
    of a town hall. Placing this building should see residential and commercial
    sky scrapers grow more easily in your city.
