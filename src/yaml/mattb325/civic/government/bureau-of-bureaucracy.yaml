  summary: "Bureau of Bureaucracy"
  description: >
    This alternate Bureau of Bureaucracy reward is based on a real building in
    the US city Texarkana.  It is an example of the Beaux Arts style, which was
    popular for government buildings in the late 1920s and early 1930s, as its
    domineering style represented stability and permanence.

    It sits on a 4x4 lot is modded as a similar variation of the default
    Bureau of Bureaucracy.
