  description: |
    This is an iconic early 1960's building inspired by the Council Building in
    Perth's Stirling Gardens. This is an example of the modernist style with
    Bauhaus leanings, and has distinctive external 'T' shaped sun-shades in
    alternating patterns over the curtain glass wall to block out the hot
    Western Australian sun.

    This BAT functions as a government building and town hall in game.
    In addition to providing 185 civic jobs, it will help alleviate the
    commercial demand caps that can hinder city development.
