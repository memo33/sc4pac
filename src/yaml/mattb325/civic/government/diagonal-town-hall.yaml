  summary: "Diagonal Town Hall"
  description: >
    This BAT is based on the National Audit Office in London. The original
    building was actually an airport terminal. The building has been designed
    to be placed along diagonal roads. The lot size is 1x2 but the building
    overhangs across 6 tiles. This building is offered as a non-conditional
    Town Hall reward. It provides 480 civic jobs and has all of the benefits
    (commercial and residential boost) of a town hall.
