  summary: "Diagonal Courthouse"
  description: >
    This is a purely fictional larger style courthouse that is aligned to
    diagonal roads and avenues. This building is designed to bolster policing
    efficiency: it also provides cap relief for R$$, R$$ and CO$$.

    It sits on a 1x2 lot with large overhang, and provides 240 civic jobs.
