  summary: "Bankstown Council Chambers and Civic Center"
  description: >
    This is a campus-style council chambers and civic center building. This is
    a modified model based on the auditorium, council offices and tourist
    information kiosk of a similarly scaled complex in suburban Sydney.

    This is a very specific architectural style that was popular during the
    1960s and 1970s, when Tehran was one of the most sophisticated and popular
    destination for western tourists. Civic architecture was an early adopter
    of this simplified Persian style.

    This BAT functions as a government building and town hall in game.
    In addition to providing 310 civic jobs, it will help alleviate the commercial
    demand caps that can hinder city development. It has also been modded to provide
    residential cap relief and increase desirability.

    It is designed for a 10x7 lot and this building looks best when used in either
    a suburban setting or to be break up a larger downtown area.
