  summary: "An old style meeting hall for your cities and towns."
  description: >
    In many smaller towns and larger cities, meeting halls often took the place
    of the Town Hall. They were an important part of civic life, and while many
    had a quasi-religous purpose, many were purely non-sectarian.

    This colonnaded Italianate building with its little tower is offered as
    a non-conditional reward and is a modified version of the Town Hall reward.
    It sits on a 2x3 lot and provides park and landmark effects.
