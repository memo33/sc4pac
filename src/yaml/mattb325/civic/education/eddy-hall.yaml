  summary: "Eddy Hall, Minnesota"
  description: >
    Inspired by the real Eddy Hall, constructed in 1886 as the Mechanic Arts
    Building for the University of Minnesota. The actual building is a simplified
    Queen Anne style executed in red-brick and red sandstone trim. The square
    tower which is slightly offset from the centre of the building dominates the
    frontage; it, together with the multi-gabled roof, large windows, patterned
    brick panels and wrough iron cresting make this a charming, eye catching building.

    This version is offered as a ploppable college on a 4x4 lot.
