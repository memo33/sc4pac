  summary: "Urban School"
  description: >
    This is a large school which combines junior, senior, and adult education
    under one roof.

    Placing this lot merely emulates all three functions of the Maxis Large
    Elementary School, the Maxis Large High School and the Maxis City College
    in terms of Capacity, Radius, Cost and School Effectiveness vs Average Age
    categories; using the upper limits of each school type to create a single
    multi-purpose institution. It houses up to 14,500 students and has a very
    large coverage radius. EQ Boost and Population vs Distance stats are the
    same as the standard Maxis schools.

    The Bat itself is fictional, and is based on any number of more modern
    educational institutions. The central entrance area houses adminsitration,
    cafeteria, gymnasium/indoor courts & auditorium; the junior school is housed
    in the smaller wing, and the senior school laboratories and workshops in the
    larger wing. The adult college uses the senior wing after 5pm once all of the
    students and day teachers have gone home.

    This is a large building and lot, weighing in at 8x8 tiles (a bit over 4
    acres in the old parlance) and has ample room for a soccer pitch, grassed
    relaxation areas and the typical asphalt surfaces where countless kids can
    graze their elbows and knees when falling over.

    It provides 390 civic jobs.
