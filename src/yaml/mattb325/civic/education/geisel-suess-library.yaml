  summary: "Geisel Suess Library, San Diego"
  description: >
    This futuristic brutalist building that looks part space-invader, part
    minecraft creation, is the main library building of the University of
    California San Diego.  The design draws inspiration from hands holding
    piles of books aloft.

    In game, this is a large library and sits on a 5x5 lot. It is found in
    the education menu and provides 235 civic jobs, holds 680,000 books and
    provides an EQ boost to all age groups over a large radius.
