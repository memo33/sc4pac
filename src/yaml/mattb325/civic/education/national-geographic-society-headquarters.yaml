  summary: "National Geographic Society Headquarters (museum)"
  description: >
    The National Geographic Society Headquarters was built in 1963 in the what
    is known as the new formalist style.  It is made of concrete, marble and
    glass and conveys a uniform and symmetrical appearance; the marble columns
    provide strong verticality and are a reinterpretation of earlier classical,
    temple like forms. This is especially true of the upper floors and projecting
    fins along the colonnade.

    This version is a high-capacity museum on a 6x2 lot, providing 235 civic jobs.
