  summary: "City College"
  description: >
    This BAT is based on an Adult Education College on Sydney's North Shore.
    It is a new build, but is designed to look 'Olde Worlde' and as such is
    quite a mish-mash of styles.

    This version is a 3x3 ploppable College reward with a capacity of 4,850.
