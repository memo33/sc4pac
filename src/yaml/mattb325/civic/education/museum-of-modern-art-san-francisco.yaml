  summary: "Museum of Modern Art, San Francisico"
  description: >
    The Museum of Modern Art (MOMA), San Francisco is a non-profit organisation
    and holds an internationally recognised collection of modern and contemporary
    art, and was the first museum on the US West Coast devoted solely to 20th
    Century art.

    The present building was designed by Mario Botta in the late 1980s and the
    building - as depicted here in SC4 - was completed in 1995.

    This building acts as a Museum and sits on a 4x4 lot providing 315 civic jobs
    and gives a large educational boost across a wide radius.
