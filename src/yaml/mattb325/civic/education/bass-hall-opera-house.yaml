  summary: "Bass Hall Opera House"
  description: >
    The Bass Performance Hall is in Fort Worth Texas. It seats 2,056 people.
    Built as a multi-purpose facility, the Hall is able to house symphony,
    ballet, opera, stage, musicals, and rock concerts. The building is
    reminiscent of the classic European Opera Houses: the building is
    constructed of limestone and was built in 1998.

    In game, this is offered as a non-conditional Opera House Reward. It does
    not override the in-game Opera House Reward.

    The stats have been made in accordance with the opera house bug fix (the
    vanilla Maxis opera house fills up very quickly and then causes your city
    to have all sorts of problems), but please note that the bug fix is not
    necessary for this download.

    It sits on a 4x4 lot and provides 281 civic jobs. It also gives a
    region-wide residential, commercial and IHT boost, and increases
    desirability in the surrounding radius.
