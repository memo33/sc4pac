    This is an eye-catching modern midrise building that definitely helps break
    the grid when it grows.  It has upper roof gardens (both as open terraces
    and semi-enclosed spaces (the areas under the metal lattice-work at either
    end of the building).

    This version offers a ploppable college lot providing 229 jobs and capacity
    for 6,700 students.
