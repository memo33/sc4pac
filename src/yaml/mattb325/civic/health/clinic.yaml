  description: >
    Inspired by a little clinic in Southern Europe, this is a smaller medical
    facility for towns or to supplement larger hospital care.
    The lot comes as a ploppable Clinic, which is found in the Health Menu and
    has a decent capacity (1,500) and radius (600). It provides 57 civic jobs.
