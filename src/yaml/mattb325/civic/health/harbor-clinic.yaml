  summary: "Harbor Clinic"
  description: >
    Inspired by a rather imposing mid-century building on Wilshire Blvd,
    Los Angeles, Harbor Clinic operates as a large hospital in game.

    This 6-floor building is substantial; its 100 meter street frontage is broken
    by a large blank entrance wall clad in marble tiles for its full height and
    makes for a striking streetscape addition in real life.

    As it sits on a 7x4 lot, this is useful for urban and suburban areas.
    It has an expanded coverage radius and high patient capacity and provides
    quite a number of civic jobs in all wealth categories. It has a patient
    capacity of 12,250.
