  summary: "James Park House"
  description: >
    Listed on the US National Register of Historic Places since 1972, the house
    was built by merchant and Knoxville Mayor James Park in 1812, making it the
    second-oldest building in downtown Knoxville.

    This is a hospital reward which sits on a 2x2 lot.  It comes with a
    custom foundation, making it suitable for placement in hilly areas. The stats
    of this hospital are basically aligned to the ingame version.
