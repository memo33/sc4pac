  summary: "Dental Clinic"
  description: >
    This little building is inspired by a real such mid-century low rise building
    near downtown Los Angeles. In game, this supplements the main hospital
    function and the capacities have been modded to sit mid way between the clinic
    and standard hospital. But it will work equally well in a smaller city without
    the need for an additional hospital.

    It sits on a 2x2 lot and provides 68 civic jobs.
