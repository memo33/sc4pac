  summary: "Community hall based on the Ballhaus Ost in Berlin"
  description: >
    Made as a request, this building is based on the Ballhaus Ost in Berlin.
    Originally a mourning hall, it has since been converted to a community
    space and theatre.

    The BAT comes on a 2x3 lot and it is found in the reward menu. It offers a
    handful of jobs and will boost surrounding desirability for business and
    residential, as well as provide landmark, park and mayor effects.
