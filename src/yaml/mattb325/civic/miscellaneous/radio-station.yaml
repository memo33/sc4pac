  summary: "Radio Station"
  description: >
    Like the ingame Radio Station this lot is basically used as a cap buster;
    it increases desirability, mayor rating and also substantially lifts the
    demand cap for R$$ and Manufacturing jobs. Given how most of the industrial
    custom content available leans towards the manufacturing genre, these caps
    are usually hit fairly early, so placing the radio station in each city tile
    will assist in ensuring there is still regional demand for IM jobs.

    The building was inspired by the Musick Point Padio Station in New Zealand
    which was built in the classic art deco style for use during WWII. It still
    stands today on a dramatically empty bluff looking out to sea.

    This reward lot is offered without the need to satisfy pre-existing
    conditions, can be plopped more than once in a city, and, most importantly
    DOES NOT over-write the ingame radio station.
