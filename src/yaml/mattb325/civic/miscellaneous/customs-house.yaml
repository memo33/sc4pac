  summary: "Customs House"
  description: >
    This particular Customs House is inspired by the one that has stood in Salem,
    Massachusetts since 1819 (it is not an exact replica). The basement at the
    rear of the building is used for impounding goods.

    This BAT provides civic jobs as well as lifting the demand caps (and hence
    driving demand) for Manufacturing and IHT jobs in your city and region. It
    also boosts your mayor rating.

    It is offered as a reward (without the need to meet any pre-existing criteria)
    and can be placed more than once in a city. It is found in the rewards menu.
