  summary: "Griffith Observatory"
  description: >
    The Griffith Observatory and Planetarium opened in 1935 and has a commanding
    view of the Los Angeles skyline from its prime position on the slope of
    Mount Hollywood in Griffith Park. It is an example of Art Deco &
    Streamline Moderne architecture.

    This BAT is designed to have slope tolerance and the lot is designed to be
    plopped on a hill (rather than a cliff-face).

    This building has been modded as a non-conditional reward that counts towards
    tourism and has a positive landmark, park and mayor-rating effect.
