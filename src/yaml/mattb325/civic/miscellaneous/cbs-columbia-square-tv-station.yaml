  summary: "CBS Columbia Square Television Station"
  description: |
    In 1938, Columbia Square was built for Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS)
    on the site of the Nestor Film Company, Hollywood's first movie studio, at
    6121 Sunset Boulevard. This building is an example of International
    Modernism/Streamline Moderne. It is modded as a Television Station reward.

    It does not override the in-game TV station nor any other relots. It is a
    non-conditional reward, and can be used with the Maxis TV station.
    It provides CO$$ and residential cap relief. This building counts towards
    tourism and has a positive landmark and park effect. Placing this reward
    will also provide many civic jobs.
