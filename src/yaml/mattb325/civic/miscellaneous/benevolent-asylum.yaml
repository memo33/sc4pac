  summary: "Benevolent Asylum"
  description: >
    A fictional benevolent-asylum executed in brick, slate and stone, suitable for
    towns and suburban streets.

    This benevolent-asylum has been modded very similarly to the in-game benevolent-asylum
    and provides a landmark effect and relief cap for R$$/R$$$ and CO$$ jobs.

    This is a non-conditional reward and may be plopped multiple times.
