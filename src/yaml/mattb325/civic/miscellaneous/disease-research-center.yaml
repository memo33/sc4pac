  summary: "Alternate Disearch Research Center (radiation free!)"
  description: >
    This requirement-free civic reward is offered as an alternative to the default disease research center.
    It is modded reasonably similarly to the in-game version, but does not emit radiation.
    This mod does not override the Maxis version, both may co-exist.
