  summary: "Galaxy Casino & Hotel"
  description: >
    Sleek, modern, high-rise casino reward. It has less severe side-effects
    than the default casino, (it won't cause a city-wide spike in crime or drop
    in mayor rating) but it still discourages nearby R$$$ development.
    This is a non-conditional reward that operates a business deal.
