  summary: "Modern Fire Station"
  description: >
    This police station is inspired by the newly built fire stations that you
    find in many outer urban areas. They are cheap and quick to build, and
    basically all look the same. In true functionalist style, it is given red
    trim work to easily denote its function.

    Stars-wise, it is similar to the in-game fire station, with a larger coverage
    radius. It provides 17 civic jobs and is found in the fire menu.
