  description: >
     This large coverage and large dispatch fire station is housed in an old
     Edwardian building with shops along the street frontage and offices on the
     upper floors. The main garaging for the fire trucks is at the rear with
     additional emergency access through the large central arch if needed.
     The building is an overhanging 1x1 lot.
