  summary: "A simple, yet idyllic church typical of rural New England"
  description: >
    The New England style of Church surrounded by deciduous trees in autumnal
    hues is an often photographed building: they are - pictorially at least -
    an archetypal representation of the rural idyll of America's North East.

    This BAT is typical of the style: quite utilitarian, made of weatherboard
    and timber painted in crisp white (including the steeple). The buildings
    have classical, greek-revival style elements such as dentil moldings and
    ionic columns executed in timber, but overall, they are restrained
    and unadorned.

    This church is on a 2x3 lot and it is found in the reward menu. This church
    is modded in such a way as to be most beneficial to smaller towns, but of
    course it can be placed in a big city if you wish.

    It will boost surrounding desirability for residential and provides cap
    relief as well as park and mayor effects. It also has some slope tolerance
    to enable you to replicate the typical new england small town scene.
