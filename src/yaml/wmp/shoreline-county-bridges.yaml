  summary: The Bridges of Shoreline County
  description: |
    A series of eye-candy only bridges for both rural and urban areas. All bridges, with the exception of the transit-enabled version of the Wooden Bridge (5x1), are 1x1 lots with the respective bridge off-set. The covered bridges and the standard wooden bridge are for heights up to 8m; the Hang Ten bridge can cover variable heights and even small rivers or bays. The Pont Tarielle and the transit-enabled Wooden Bridge have a clearing height of 5m which is sufficient for cars but not for trucks or buses. Covered bridges have a clearing height of 7.5m. All lots come with a transparent base, and should work well with ploppable water.
