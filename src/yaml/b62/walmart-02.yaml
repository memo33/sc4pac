  summary: "Ploppable and growable Walmart supercenter"
  description: >
    Many trace discount retailing's birth to 1962, the first year of operation for Kmart, Target and Wal-Mart. Sam Walton and his wife, Helen, put up 95 percent of the money for the first Wal-Mart store in Rogers, Arkansas - borrowing heavily on Sam's vision that the American consumer was hinting to a different type of general store. As of today, Sam's gamble is a global company with more than 1.3 million associates worldwide and nearly 5,000 stores and wholesale clubs across 10 countries.
     
    This BAT was originally created by Bobbo662 (aka B62). Unfortunately, due to real life circumstances, he was unable to finish the lot and was just sitting around on his hard drive. After talking to him, he graciously handed his work over to me to finish and subsequently upload for yall.
