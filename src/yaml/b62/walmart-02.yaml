  summary: "Ploppable and growable Walmart supercenter"
  description: |
    Many trace discount retailing's birth to 1962, the first year of operation for Kmart, Target and Wal-Mart.
    Sam Walton and his wife, Helen, put up 95 percent of the money for the first Wal-Mart store in Rogers, Arkansas -
    borrowing heavily on Sam's vision that the American consumer was hinting to a different type of general store.
    As of today, Sam's gamble is a global company with more than 1.3 million associates worldwide
    and nearly 5,000 stores and wholesale clubs across 10 countries.

    This package contains 6x10 CS$ growable and ploppable lots.
    Both come in two styles: a stand-alone lot, as well as a modular lot expandable with KOSC's ploppable parking set.
