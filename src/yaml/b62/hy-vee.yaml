    This beautiful BAT was originally created by Bobbo662 (aka B62). Unfortunately, due to real life circumstances, he was unable to finish the lot and so this was just sitting around on his hard drive. After talking to him, he graciously handed his work over to me to finish and subsequently upload for yall.
