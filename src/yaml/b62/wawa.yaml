  summary: "Ploppable and growable gas station with adjacent car show lot"
  description: |
    'Wawa' is a Lenni Lenape Indian word for the Canada Goose that was found in the Delaware Valley, hence it's use in the logo.
    Wawa offers a large fresh food selection, including built-to-Order Hoagies, fresh-brewed coffee, quality dairy products and Wawa brand juices and teas.
    All Wawa stores also feature a wide selection of ready-to-go salads, fresh fruits and produce.

    This download also includes a Car Show to include in your cities.
    A feature originally suggested by member Hotwheeler, the Car Show will provide a moderate YIMBY effect for your cities.
    While it looks best placed next to the Wawa Gas Station, it can also be plopped anywhere on its own.

    The Gas Station comes as a 4x4 CS$ growable and ploppable lot.

    The Car Show is a 6x4 ploppable landmark without jobs.
