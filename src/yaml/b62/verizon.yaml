  summary: "A Verizon cellular broadcast tower"
  description: >
    Lately your sims have been complaining about the crappy cell service in your city.
    Luckily, you decided to commission this new Verizon Substation in your city to boost service before the sims riot.

    This package contains a 3x3 I-HT growable and ploppable lot.

    Additionally, this package adds a Verizon Van as automata that may or may not spawn when you place the lot.
    It was created by Swamper77, an authority on automata.
