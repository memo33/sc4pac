Sears Grand is a one-level store that carries everything from milk to refrigerators, bathing suits to sun block and car seats to baby food - they also are the only store to carry their Craftsman, and Kenmore products. Shoppers will also find an array of convenient services at Sears Grand including: auto center, custom paint mixing, window blind cutting and key cutting.'
