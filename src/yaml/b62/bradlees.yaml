    A little bit like Ames Department Store but with bigger stores located in bigger towns,and a very unique layout. They offered general merchandise with many discounts all year around.  They had 130 stores before they filed for Chapter 11, and then came back with 102 stores in 1997 up to 105 stores in 2000. CEO Peter Thorner cleaned up the financial problems of the company and wanted to see Bradlees operating 150 stores.  They did opened new stores including one in a former Caldor in Staten Island.  Emerging from Chapter 11 in February of 1999, nobody cold have predicted the kind of end they announced on December 26th 2000. (Isn't that something, spend all your hard earn cash on Christmas and then come back from the holidays and WHAMMO! - no job!)
    
    Bradlee's store layout was different from Wal-Mart and K-Mart. Wide open, entering the store you could see from one end of the store to the other, not that the store was small, but the ceiling was high, aisles not tall, it was simple, and easy to shop.
    
    First Bradlees opened their doors in 1958 in New London, CT.  The name \Bradlees\" was taken from Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks, CT where the Company's earliest planning meetings were held.  The Stop & Shop Co. acquired the chain in 1961.  The Company operated 105 stores in seven (7) Northeastern states: Main, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania.\n\nThis BAT was originally created by Bobbo662 (aka B62). Unfortunately, due to real life circumstances, he was unable to finish the lot. He graciously handed his work over to me to finish and subsequently upload for yall.  \n\n8x8 CS$ Plop, 8x8 CS$ Grow (right corner only: _| )\n     Growth Stage : 2\n     Jobs : 2012 CS$\n     Plop Cost : $35000\n     Bulldoze Cost : $3500\n     Power Consumed : 35\n     Water Consumed : 15\n     Air/Water Pollution : Negligible\n     Garbage Pollution : 16 over 4 tiles\n     Flammability : 45"
