  description: >
    The first Sam's Club opened in April 1983 in Midwest City, Oklahoma in the United States.
    Sam's Club is named after the founder of Wal-Mart, Sam Walton.
    To purchase items from Sam's Club, one must purchase a membership.
    Many Sam's Club customers are small businesses (such as bowling alleys) that wish to offer customers a limited selection of food without the expense of having it delivered.
    In 1993, Wal-Mart acquired PACE Membership Warehouse and converted them into Sam's Clubs.

    This package contains a 8x10 CS$ growable and ploppable lot.
