    The first Sam's Club opened in April 1983 in Midwest City, Oklahoma in the United States. Sam's Club is named after the founder of Wal-Mart, Sam Walton. To purchase items from Sam's Club, one must purchase a membership. Many Sam's Club customers are small businesses (such as bowling alleys) that wish to offer customers a limited selection of food without the expense of having it delivered. In 1993, Wal-Mart acquired PACE Membership Warehouse and converted them into Sam's Clubs.

    This BAT was originally created by Bobbo662 (aka B62). Unfortunately, due to real life circumstances, he was unable to finish the lot. He graciously handed his work over to me to finish and subsequently upload for yall.
