  summary: "Ploppable and growable Walmart supercenter"
  description: >
    Many trace discount retailing's birth to 1962, the first year of operation for Kmart, Target and Wal-Mart.
    Sam Walton and his wife, Helen, put up 95 percent of the money for the first Wal-Mart store in Rogers, Arkansas -
    borrowing heavily on Sam's vision that the American consumer was hinting to a different type of general store.
    As of today, Sam's gamble is a global company with more than 1.3 million associates worldwide
    and nearly 5,000 stores and wholesale clubs across 10 countries.

    This package contains an 8x8 ploppable as well as 6x6 and 8x8 CS$ growable lots.
