  summary: "Ploppable and growable electronics store"
  description: |
    Circuit City Stores, Inc. was an American multinational consumer electronics corporation.
    It was founded in 1949 and pioneered the electronics superstore format in the 1970s.
    Circuit City liquidated its final American retail store in 2009, following a bankruptcy filing and subsequent failure to find a buyer.
    At the time of liquidation, Circuit City was the second largest U.S. electronics retailer, after Best Buy.
    There were 567 Circuit City Superstores nationwide, ranging in size from 15,000 to 45,000 square feet.

    This package contains a 6x10 CS$ growable and ploppable lot.
    It utilizes both the timed props contained in SHK parking pack and seasonal trees. These items may take a day or so to appear.
