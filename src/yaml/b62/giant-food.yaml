  description: |
    Giant Food of Maryland, LLC, also known as Giant, is an American supermarket chain that was founded in 1936 when N.M. Cohen and Samuel Lehrman opened Washington, DC's first supermarket. Since its start, Giant has pioneered computer-assisted checkout scanning and operates over 170 stores and 156 full-service pharmacies located in Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, and Washington, D.C.
    
    This beautiful BAT was originally created by Bobbo662 (aka B62). Unfortunately, due to real life circumstances, he was unable to finish the lot and so this was just sitting around on his hard drive. After talking to him, he graciously handed his work over to me to finish and subsequently upload for yall.
