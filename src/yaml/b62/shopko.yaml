  summary: "Ploppable and growable department store"
  description: >
    Shopko was founded in 1962 by James Ruben, and its first store opened in Green Bay.
    In 2012, Shopko merged with Pamida, a regional discount chain that operated mainly in smaller communities of 3,000 to 8,000 people;
    all the stores were rebranded under the Shopko Hometown name.

    This package contains a 6x8 CS$ growable and ploppable lot.
