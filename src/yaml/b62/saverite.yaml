  summary: "Ploppable and growable grocery store"
  description: >
    Winn-Dixie created the Save-Rite brand as an experiment to increase its revenues and opened 11 stores throughout its distribution area.
    In November 2001, Winn-Dixie announced plans to convert nearly all of its 40-some Winn-Dixie and Winn-Dixie Marketplace brand stores
    in the metro Atlanta area into Save-Rites as a last-ditch effort to keep a hold on its market share,
    which was rapidly declining due to stiff competition from Wal-Mart, Publix, Kroger, Ingles, Food Lion, and other similar stores.

    This package contains a 7x6 CS$ growable and ploppable lot.
