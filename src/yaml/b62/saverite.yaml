  summary: "Ploppable and growable grocery store"
  description: |
    Winn-Dixie created the Save-Rite brand as an experiment to increase its revenues and opened 11 stores throughout its distribution area. In November 2001, Winn-Dixie announced plans to convert nearly all of its 40-some Winn-Dixie and Winn-Dixie Marketplace brand stores in the metro Atlanta area into Save-Rites as a last-ditch effort to keep a hold on its market share, which was rapidly declining due to stiff competition from Wal-Mart, Publix, Kroger, Ingles, Food Lion, and other similar stores.

    This BAT was originally created by Bobbo662 (aka B62). Unfortunately, due to real life circumstances, he was unable to finish the lot. He graciously handed his work over to me to finish and subsequently upload for yall.
