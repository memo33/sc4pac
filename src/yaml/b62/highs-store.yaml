  description: |
    In 1928, the High's brand was born as a quickly growing chain of ice cream stores in the Mid-Atlantic states.
    At one time there were more than 500 locations, making High's the largest ice cream store chain in the world.
    Today, High's is a chain of 50 convenience stores run by a team of 600 talented individuals.
    High's is a subsidiary of the Carroll Independent Fuel Company, a 105-year-old, family owned, Baltimore-based supplier of motor fuel products.

    This package contains a 2x2 CS$ growable and ploppable lot.
