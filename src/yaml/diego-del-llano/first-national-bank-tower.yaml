  summary: First National Bank Tower
  description: |
    The First National Bank Tower is a 634 ft (193 m), 45-story skyscraper at 1601 Dodge Street in downtown Omaha, Nebraska.
    Completed in 2002, it is currently the tallest building in Nebraska.
    It was built on the site of the former Medical Arts Building which was imploded on April 2, 1999.
    Inside the glass lobby is a large section of the ornamental facade from the former Medical Arts Building.

    The First National Bank Tower also plays host to Trek up the Tower, a vertical stair climb race up to the top of the tower.
    This race is presented by The Wellness Council of the Midlands.

    The building is the headquarters of First National of Nebraska.
