  summary: Simmons Tower
  description: >
    Simmons Bank Tower is a 40-story skyscraper located at 425 West Capitol Avenue in downtown Little Rock, Arkansas.
    At 547 feet (167 m) high, it is currently the tallest building in Arkansas.

    The new tower was born out of discussions between two ascending business executives, John Flake, a Little Rock real estate developer, and Jerry Maulden, president of Arkansas Power & Light (now Entergy).
    Construction began in 1984 on the $72 million building, and in 1986 the building was completed and dubbed The Capitol Tower.
    Currently, the namesake tenant, Simmons Bank, is headquartered in the tower with presence in various markets of Arkansas, Missouri, Kansas, and Tennessee.
    Flake & Kelley Commercial, the current name of the development firm of the tower, performs the management and leasing of the tower, and the Doyle Rogers Company is the special asset manager.
