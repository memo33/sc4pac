    The Olympia Centre is a skyscraper in Chicago.
    It is a mixed use building consisting of offices in the lower part of the building and residences in the narrower upper section.
    It was designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill LLP, and at 725 ft (221 m) tall, with 63 floors, it is Chicago's tallest mid-block building.
    The exterior is Swedish granite, which was completed in Italy.
