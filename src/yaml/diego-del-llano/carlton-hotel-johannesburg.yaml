  summary: Carlton Hotel Johannesburg
  description: >
    The Carlton Hotel is a historic hotel in the Central Business District of Johannesburg, South Africa.
    It opened in 1972 as part of the enormous Carlton Centre complex, and has been closed since 1998.

    The enormous, modern Carlton Centre, built at a cost of R88 million, would contain a fifty-story office tower, the tallest in Africa; the thirty-story luxury Carlton Hotel; a five-story Garlicks department store; a huge three-and-a-half-acre public plaza with a two-story underground shopping centre beneath it containing 140 shops; parking garages with space for 2000 cars; and an adjacent 57,000 square-foot exhibition centre with an indoor ice skating rink on the top level.
    The complex was designed by noted American architect Gordon Bunshaft, of the internationally renowned firm of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, working in conjunction with the local Johannesburg firm of Rhodes-Harrison Hoffe and Partners.
    Anglo American bought out SAB's share of the project in 1969, while it was still under construction.
