  summary: Shaklee Terraces, One Front Street
  description: >
    One Front Street, also known as Shaklee Terraces, is an office skyscraper in the Financial District of San Francisco, California.
    The 164 m (538 ft), 38-floor tower was completed in 1979.
    The composition of the fa√ßade closely resembles that of the Shell Building by Emil Fahrenkamp, which was built in Berlin in 1931.
    The Shaklee Corporation was once headquartered in the tower until the company moved to Pleasanton, California in 2000.
    In 1999-2001 Scient Corporation, a dot-com era consulting firm, had its head office on the upper floors of the building, prior to its move to Market Street.
