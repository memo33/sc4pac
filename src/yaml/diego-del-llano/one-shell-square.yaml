  summary: One Shell Square
  description: >
    One Shell Square is a 51-story, 697-foot (212 m) skyscraper designed in the International style by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, located at 701 Poydras Street in the Central Business District of New Orleans, Louisiana.
    It is the tallest building in both the city of New Orleans and the state of Louisiana, and is taller than Louisiana's tallest peak, Driskill Mountain.
    The building is primarily used for leaseable office space, with some retail space on the ground level.
    The design of the building is very similar to Houston's One Shell Plaza and Denver's Republic Plaza, both built by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill.
    Hines Interest is the developer of One Shell Square and Lincoln Property Company.
    Shell Oil Company is the building's largest tenant.
    Current occupancy of the building is approximately 90 percent.
