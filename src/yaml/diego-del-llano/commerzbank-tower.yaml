  summary: Commerzbank Tower
  description: >
    Commerzbank Tower is a 56-story, 259 m (850 ft) skyscraper in the Innenstadt district of Frankfurt, Germany.
    An antenna spire with a signal light on top gives the tower a total height of 300.1 m (985 ft).
    It is the tallest building in Frankfurt and the tallest building in Germany.
    It had been the tallest building in Europe from its completion in 1997 until 2003 when it was surpassed by the Triumph-Palace in Moscow.
    The Commerzbank Tower is only two metres taller than the Messeturm, which is also located in Frankfurt.
    The Messeturm had been the tallest building in Europe before the construction of the Commerzbank Tower.
