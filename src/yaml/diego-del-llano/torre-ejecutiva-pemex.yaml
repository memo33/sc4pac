  summary: Torre Ejecutiva Pemex
  description: >
    The Pemex Executive Tower (Spanish: Torre Ejecutiva Pemex) is a skyscraper in Mexico City.
    The 214 meter (211 meters to top floor) international style tower was built between 1976 and 1982.
    Since the building's opening, it has been occupied by state-owned Pemex, one of the largest petroleum companies in the world.

    The Torre Ejecutiva Pemex originally proposed to replace two 14-story towers built between 1967 and 1970.
    Later, these buildings were replaced by a pair of 26-story towers to house Pemex's administrative offices.
    However, the 1980s oil boom demanded office space growth and Pemex decided to build a single 52-story tower in a downtown lot with a huge plaza covering an underground avenue.
    The building is anchored to the ground, rests on 164 concrete and steel piles that penetrate to a depth of 35 meters surpassing the old filling swampy lake to reach firmer ground.
    In addition, its x-braced structure features 90 shock-absorbers to minimize oscillations from earthquakes.
    The tower was completed in 1982, but the surrounding plaza was never completed.
