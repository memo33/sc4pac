  summary: Citigroup Center New York, 601 Lexington Avenue
  description: >
    The Citigroup Center (formerly Citicorp Center and now known by its address, 601 Lexington Avenue) is an office tower in New York City, located at 53rd Street between Lexington Avenue and Third Avenue in midtown Manhattan.
    It was built in 1977 to house the headquarters of Citibank. It is 915 feet (279 m) tall, and has 59 floors with 1.3 million square feet (120,000 m²) of office space.

    The building is one of the most distinctive and imposing in New York's skyline, thanks to a 45° angled top and a unique stilt-style base.
    It was designed by architect Hugh Stubbins and structural engineer William LeMessurier.
    The building is currently owned by Boston Properties, and in 2009, was renamed 601 Lexington Avenue.
