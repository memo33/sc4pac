  summary: Wells Fargo Center Denver
  description: >
    Wells Fargo Center is a building located in Denver, Colorado, United States.
    It resembles a cash register or mailboxand is known locally as the "Cash Register Building" or the "Mailbox Building".
    It is 698 feet (213 m) high, the third tallest building in Denver.
    It is shorter than the Republic Plaza building 714 feet (218 m) and the CenturyLink Tower, at 709 feet (216 m).
    The building sits on a hill, making its overall elevation higher than the two taller buildings, but its ground-to-roof height is less.
    It is 52 stories tall.

    The building was designed by architect Philip Johnson and was completed in 1983.
    As it was originally designed for a downtown area in Texas, a heated roof is necessary to prevent snow from accumulating and sliding dangerously off the curved crown.
    Located at 1700 Lincoln Street, a skybridge over Lincoln Street connects the Wells Fargo Center to the building at 1700 Broadway which houses a food court, a small museum featuring artifacts, and memorabilia from Wells Fargo history, and the Downtown Denver branch of Wells Fargo Bank.
    Both buildings have large atriums constructed in the same cash register style.
