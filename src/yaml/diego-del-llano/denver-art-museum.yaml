  summary: "Denver Art Museum: Frederic C Hamilton Building"
  description: >
    The Frederic C. Hamilton Building holds the Modern and Contemporary art collection, along with the Architecture and Design collection, and Oceanic art collection.
    The unique building also serves as the main entrance to the rest of the museum complex.[8]This ambitious project doubled the size of the museum, allowing for an expansion of the art on view, inside a bold aesthetic facade.

    The complex deconstructivist geometric design of the Hamilton building consists 20 sloping planes, covered in 230,000 square feet of titanium shingles.
    The angular design juts in many directions, supported by a 2,740-ton structure that contains more than 3,100 pieces of steel.
    One of the angled elements extends 100 feet (30 m) over the street below.
    None of the 20 planes is parallel or perpendicular to another.[9]
