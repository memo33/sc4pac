  description: |
    BD Bacatá (abbreviation for Bogotá Downtown Bacatá) is an architectural complex currently under construction in Bogotá, Colombia, featuring the tallest building in the country, surpassing the Torre Colpatria, and the sixth tallest in South America.
    The South Tower is 67 stories high and covers a total surface area of 1,200,000 square feet (111,480 m2).
    Development includes office and retail space, apartments and a 364-room hotel, replacing the former Hotel Bacatá that was constructed in the same location.
    It will be the tallest skyscraper in Colombia, and the first crowdfunded skyscraper, meaning that it was funded by private individuals through the purchase of shares and fiduciary rights allowed under Colombian law.
