  description: >
    Nelson Tower is a 46 story 171 meter (560 feet) tall building located at 450 7th Avenue in Manhattan, New York City, United States.

    It was completed in 1931 and became the tallest building in the Garment District of New York.
    Today it is dwarfed by the 60 story One Penn Plaza that sits across 34th Street from the Nelson Tower but still visible from most directions except the southeast.
    It was designed by H.
    Craig Severance.
    The building was originally planned and built by New York developer, Julius Nelson.
