  summary: The Look Building
  description: >
    488 Madison Avenue, also known as the Look Building, is a 25-story office building in the Midtown Manhattan neighborhood of New York City.
    It is along Madison Avenue's western sidewalk between 51st and 52nd Streets, near St. Patrick's Cathedral.
    488 Madison Avenue was designed by Emery Roth & Sons in the International Style, and it was constructed and developed by Uris Brothers.
    The building was originally named for its primary tenant, the American magazine Look.

    The building largely contains a facade of white brick, interspersed with horizontal strips of aluminum windows.
    The lowest two stories contain a main entrance on Madison Avenue as well as several glass-and-metal storefronts.
    The three sides are connected by curved walls.
    The exterior includes several setbacks to comply with the 1916 Zoning Resolution. Each of the building's stories contain an average floor area of 19,500 square feet (1,810 m2), a feature intended to maximize usable office space.
