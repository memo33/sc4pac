  description: >
    1250 René-Lévesque, also known as the IBM-Marathon Tower, is a 226 m (741 ft), 47-story skyscraper in Montreal,Quebec, Canada.
    The building was designed by Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates for IBM Canada and Marathon Realty, hence the former name "IBM-Marathon".
    It is now named for its address at 1250 René Lévesque Boulevard West, in the Ville-Marie borough of Downtown Montreal.
    It is adjacent to the Bell Centre and Windsor Station to the south, and stands on the site of the former American Presbyterian Church.
    It is connected to the Bonaventure metro station and the underground city network.

    1250 is currently owned and managed by global real estate investor, developer and owner Oxford Properties and is still partially occupied by IBM.
