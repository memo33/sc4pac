  summary: Centurylink Tower Denver (1801 California Street)
  description: >
    1801 California Street, also known as CenturyLink Tower, is a skyscraper in Denver, Colorado.
    The building was completed in 1983, and rises 53 floors and 709 feet (216 m) in height.
    The building stands as the second-tallest building in Denver and Colorado, and as the 111th-tallest building in the United States.

    1801 California Street was previously occupied by offices for US West, and then served as the world headquarters ofQwest Communications.
    In summer 2011 following CenturyLink's acquisition of Qwest, the Qwest sign was removed from the top and replaced with the CenturyLink sign.
    Upon its completion in 1983, the building stood as the tallest building in the city.
    However, it held that distinction for less than a year, being surpassed by Republic Plaza in 1984.
