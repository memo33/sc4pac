  summary: Federal Center Chicago
  description: >
    Also known as Federal Plaza, this urban square unifies Ludwig Mies van der Rohe’s complex of three buildings of varying scales: the mid-rise Everett McKinley Dirksen Building, the high-rise John C. Kluczynski Building, and the single-story Post Office building.
    The granite tiles of the plaza continuously flow into the glazed lobbies of these International style, glass curtain-wall edifices, visually and physically connecting the interior and exterior spaces.
    Low, rectangular granite benches and raised planters define and edge the plaza, while a square planting area with four deciduous trees offers shade for several additional benches.
    Alexander Calder’s iconic red sculpture, the 53-foot “Flamingo,” adds vibrant color to the black and grey pavement.
    The piece was commissioned by the Government Services Administration and installed in 1974 to great fanfare, unveiled following a parade celebrating Calder’s work, with the artist sitting atop a circus wagon pulled by 40 horses.
    Associated architects that have played a role in the complex’s long history from 1959 to 1974 include Schmidt, Garden & Erickson; C.F. Murphy Associates; and A. Epstein & Sons.
    The plaza is home to a regular farmers market and is a frequent site for political gatherings.
