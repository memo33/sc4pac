  summary: Willoughby Tower
  description: >
    Willoughby Tower, at 8 S. Michigan avenue, on the southwest corner of E. Madison street, built in 1929, is 36 stories high, on caissons.
    Samuel N. Crowen was the architect.
    The eight-story Willoughby building (Western Bank Note building) previously occupied this corner.

    The newest design for the Willoughby Tower, by S.V. Croweon, architect, to be erected at the southwest corner of Madison and Boul Mich was announced on February 4, 1928.
    It is almost changed from the first design shown in The Tribune of Sunday, Sept. 18, 1927.
    Instead of being black, itâ€™ll be of variegated Indiana limestone on the two street elevations, with the first two floors of granite.
    The tower will be flood lighted.
    Work started May 1, 1928.
