  summary: Us Bank Library Tower
  description: >
    U.S.
    Bank Tower, formerly Library Tower and First Interstate Bank World Center, is a 1,018-foot (310.3 m) skyscraper at 633 West Fifth Street in downtown Los Angeles, California.
    It is the third tallest building in California, the second tallest building in LA, the fifteenth tallest in the United States, the third tallest west of the Mississippi River after the Salesforce Tower and the Wilshire Grand Tower, and the 92nd tallest building in the world, after being surpassed by the Wilshire Grand Center.
    Because local building codes required all high-rise buildings to have a helipad, it was known as the tallest building in the world with a roof-top heliport from its completion in 1989 to 2004 when Taipei 101 opened.
    It is also the third tallest building in a major active seismic region; its structure was designed to resist an earthquake of 8.3 on the Richter scale.
    It consists of 73 stories above ground and two parking levels below ground.
    Construction began in 1987 with completion in 1989.
    The building was designed by Henry N.
    Cobb of the architectural firm Pei Cobb Freed & Partners and cost $350 million to build.
    It is one of the most recognizable buildings in Los Angeles, and often appears in establishing shots for the city in films and television programs.
