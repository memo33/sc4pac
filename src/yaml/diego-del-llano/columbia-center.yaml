  description: >
    The Columbia Center, formerly named the Bank of America Tower and Columbia Seafirst Center, is a skyscraper in downtown Seattle, Washington.
    The 76-story structure is the tallest building in Seattle and the state of Washington, reaching a height of 937 ft (286 m).
    At the time of its completion, the Columbia Center was the tallest structure on the West Coast; as of 2017, it is the fourth-tallest, behind buildings in Los Angeles and San Francisco.

    The Columbia Center, developed by Martin Selig and designed by Chester L. Lindsey Architects, began construction in 1982 and was completed in 1985.
    The building is primarily leased for class-A office spaces by various companies, with the lower floors including retail space and the upper floors including a public observatory and private club lounge.
    The tower has the tallest public viewing area on the West Coast and west of the Mississippi.
    It occupies most of the block bounded by Fourth and Fifth Avenues and Cherry and Columbia Streets.
