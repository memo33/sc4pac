info:
  summary: "Park pathway overlay textures"
  description: >
     This set contains a total of 373 overlay textures geared towards dynamic and flowing park paths.

     In addition to covering standard fare orthogonal pathways, this set deeply explores inter-connectivity with other less utilized pathing options. Diagonals and FA2 pathways are given a chance to shine with an insane amount of options. Couple that with wide radius curves and s-curves and the layout options provided are practically limitless!
