  summary: Industrial Revolution Mod - Logistic Filler Set 2
  description: |
    This package contains a set of 12 filler lots: 4 for dirty, manufacturing and hi-tech industrial areas.
    Each industrial type has 2 common lot types and 2 unique ones.
    Unique lots include dump trucks and oil tankers for I-D, flatbeds with piping and random junk for I-M, and temp offices and flatbeds with objects covered in tarp for I-HT. Like previous releases, all lots are configured to be highly randomized.
    Do note that most of the lots here are wider (2x2).

    Lot stats are designed to match the original IRM fillers as closely as possible.
    Positioning indicators are present to help with lot placement and alignment. 
    Every lot is practically neutral, with negligible amounts of pollution, no power/water consumption and cost nothing to maintain.
    It takes §5 to bulldoze a lot and each are extremely cheap to plop (§5 for I-D, §6 for I-M, §7 for I-HT).
    
    The lots are located in the landmarks menu and are positioned in-line with the originals.
