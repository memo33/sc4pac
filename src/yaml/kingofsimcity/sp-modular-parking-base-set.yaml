  summary: SP Modular Parking - Base Set
  description: |

    This is the 1st part of the SuperParking modular parking series, which is aimed towards creating even more realistic and crazy parking derivatives from the original SHK Parking Pack. This is the base set, which contains all the essentials for making orthogonal oriented parking lots, junctions, and more.
    There are two different packages available for download: one for Right-hand Drive and Left-hand Drive. Choose one.

    The set contains a set of 49 lots. There are 7 functional “parking garage” pieces, with Transit Enabled connections which are located in the Misc Transportation menu, and 42 cosmetic pieces located near the top of the Parks menu. All of the menus are grouped and color coded according to the specific type of parking, ranging from A to D type.
    
    General Stats
      - Street Entrances
        - Plop Cost: $250
        - Capacity: 1,000
      - Road Entrance
        - Plop Cost: $500
        - Capacity: 1,500
      - Cosmetic Pieces
        - Plop Cost: $0 - $6

    All of the cosmetic pieces are considered “neutral lots”, meaning they have pretty much no stats, come at no maintenance cost, and are not of any particular wealth. The detailing on these lots were kept minimal, as to ensure that MMPs can be used on them liberally.
