  summary: Industrial Revolution Mod - Big Logistic Filler Set
  description: |
    This is a set of larger, prefab filler lots for dirty, manufacturing, and hi-tech industry which seek to expand logistic support for your industries.
    The set was designed with IRM in mind and as such, utilizes matching bases and walls from that of T Wrecks' original release.

    This package contains a set of 15 large prefab lots: 5 for dirty, manufacturing and hi-tech industry respectively. There are 3 dedicated transit-enabled entrances.
    The rest of the lots are dedicated to large blocks of parked semis and trailers, with 45 degree parking for semi trucks and 22.5 degree parking for trailers only.
    All of the lots are also available in a mirrored configuration.
    Lot stats are designed to match the original IRM fillers as closely as possible.

    Positioning indicators are present to help with lot placement and alignment. Every lot is practically neutral, with negligible amounts of pollution, no power/water consumption and cost nothing to maintain.
    It takes §5 to bulldoze a lot and they are also extremely cheap to plop. Due to the lots being of considerable size, the plop costs have been doubled respectively (§10 for I-D, §12 for I-M, §14 for I-HT).
    The lots are located in the landmarks menu and are positioned just after the originals.
