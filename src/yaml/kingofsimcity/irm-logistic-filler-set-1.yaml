  summary: Industrial Revolution Mod - Logistic Filler Set 1
  description: |
    This is a set of ploppable filler lots for dirty, manufacturing, and hi-tech industry which are designed to add some logistic support to your industrial areas.
    The set was designed with IRM in mind and as such, utilizes matching bases and walls from that of the original releases (`pkg=memo:industrial-revolution-mod`).

    This package contains a set of 15 filler lots: 5 for dirty, manufacturing and hi-tech industrial areas.
    All the lots have props that are highly randomized.
    Parked trailers and semi cabs will show up in many different sizes and forms and sometimes not even at all.

    Lot stats are designed to match the original IRM fillers as closely as possible.
    This includes positioning indicators to help you align the lots with respect to other things around it.
    Every lot is nearly neutral, with negligible amounts of pollution, no power/water consumption and are maintenance free.
    All lots are $5 to bulldoze and are extremely cheap to plop ($5 for I-D, $6 for I-M, $7 for I-HT).

    The lots are located in the landmarks menu and clumped together with the original filler sets.
