  summary: Industrial Revolution Mod - Base Fractional-Angle Filler Set
  description: |
    This is a set of ploppable filler lots for dirty, manufacturing, and hi-tech industry geared towards adding FA (Fractional Angle) support to the originals.
    The set was designed with IRM in mind and as such, utilizes matching bases and walls from that of T Wrecks' original release (`pkg=memo:industrial-revolution-mod`).

    This package contains a set of 12 wall filler lots: 4 for dirty, manufacturing and hi-tech industry respectively. FA2 (2x1) and FA3 (3x1) are supported and each type comes with a mirrored version.
    With the exception of I-HT variants - which are wall-less pieces - both I-D and I-M use the same walls as the originals.

    Lot stats are designed to match the original IRM fillers as closely as possible. Positioning indicators are present to help with lot placement and alignment.
    Every lot is practically neutral, with negligible amounts of pollution, no power/water consumption and cost nothing to maintain.
    It takes ยง5 to bulldoze a lot and are extremely cheap to plop (ยง5 for I-D, ยง6 for I-M, ยง7 for I-HT).

    The lots are located in the landmarks menu and are positioned in-line with the originals.
