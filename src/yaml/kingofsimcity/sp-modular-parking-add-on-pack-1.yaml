  summary: SP Modular Parking - Add-on Pack 1
  description: |
    This is the 1st addon pack of the SuperParking modular parking series. Unlike a full-blown expansion, this small pack covers some odds and ends that were missed on the original sets. These include full no road marking support for all junction variations, and a couple of transitions for a few awkward spots.

    The set contains a set of 14 lots, all of which are cosmetic pieces located near the top of the Parks menu. Like before all of the menus are grouped and color coded according to the specific type of parking.

    General Stats
      - Cosmetic Pieces
        - Plop Cost: $0 - $9

    All of the cosmetic pieces are considered “neutral lots”, meaning they have pretty much no stats, come at no maintenance cost, and are not of any particular wealth. The detailing on these lots were kept minimal, as to ensure that MMPs can be used on them liberally.
