  summary: "Small wooden duplexes (R$$)"
  description: >
    This package contains some colorful old wooden duplexes from Halifax, Nova
    Scotia, Canada. They are a design that is typical in the Schmidtville area
    of the city, with the largest concentration located on Church Street near
    the intersection with Harvey.

    Church Street apartments come to SimCity as 1×2s, 1×3s and 1×1s that grow on the
    Chicago and New York tilesets on medium density.
