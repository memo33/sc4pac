  summary: Fixes a graphical issue in a Maxis building
  description: |
    There is a texture bug in the Vanilla high-wealth commercial building 'Jenkins Consulting'.  The side wall of the building is 'open' and looks bad in the game. Textures were repaired by using a little imagination to fill in the missing parts of the outer wall.
