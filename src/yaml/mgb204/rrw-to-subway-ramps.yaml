  summary: RRW to Subway Ramps
  description: |-
    This package contains models and two lots to allow you to switch from Rail (RRW Style) to an underground subway network.

    **Limitations**

    As with all such lots, when you switch to subway only passenger traffic can continue through the subway. So either find another route for your freight traffic or perhaps consider using the dedicated URail pieces that come with the NAM.

    **Details / Stats**

    - Cost to Plop: 2,144  
    - Monthly Cost: 20  
    - Bulldoze Cost: 309  
    - Capacity: 66,000

    Otherwise the lots are neutral, causing no pollution, requiring no power/road access and providing no jobs.
