info:
  summary: "A DLL Plugin that allows the game to use more than 4 building styles"
  conflicts: "Only compatible with game version 1.1.641, the Windows digital edition."
  description: |
    This DLL mod is intended as a dependency for other mods that add new building styles beyond the 4 that Maxis included. It does not add any building styles to the game by itself.

    Moreover, the DLL fixes a game bug to make the "build all styles at once" feature work as Maxis intended.

    This package includes a new Building Style Control UI file, with room for 36 style check boxes.
  warning: |-
    This DLL plugin comes with two INI configuration files:

    * `SC4MoreBuildingStyles.ini`
    * `BuildingStyles.ini`

    To complete the installation, copy these files from the package subfolder into the root directory of your Plugins folder and edit them to set your preferences.
