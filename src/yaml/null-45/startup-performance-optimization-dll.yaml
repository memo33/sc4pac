info:
  summary: Optimizes the DBPF plugin loading that the game performs on startup.
  conflicts: "Only compatible with game version 1.1.641, the Windows digital edition."
  description: |
    The effect that the plugin has on the game's startup time will depend on your system and plugins.
    It may have little to no effect for some configurations.

    ### Features

    - Reduces the time for the game to show the SC4 logo by up to 90%.
    - Adds an optimization to the game code for large data reads.
    - Allows the game to handle plugin paths that are longer than the standard Microsoft Windows limit of 260 characters.
      - Some of the file paths used by sc4pac packages may exceed the above limit.
    - Reduce lag and city load times with large numbers of .SC4* plugins.
    - Disables the game code that searches the entire file if the DBPF signature was not found.
    - Changes the game code that loads the .SC4* files to ignore files with non-DBPF file extensions, .txt, .png, etc.
      - With this change only .SC4Desc, .SC4Lot, .SC4Model, and files without any file extension will be loaded.
      - Files without any file extension are included due to some older plugins having that issue.
    - Changes the 'missing plugin' dialog to display the plugin pack ID in hexadecimal.
