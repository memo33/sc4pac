info:
  summary: A DLL Plugin that extends the game's Lua system with new functions for developers
  conflicts: "Only compatible with game version 1.1.641, the Windows digital edition."
  description: |
    This file is a dependency for plugins that use the new Lua script functions.

    The DLL provides a number of functions that allow Lua scripts to do the following:

    * Run cheats and pause/resume the game.
    * Have better access to SC4's built-in number formatting.
    * Get or set the city/mayor names and plop lots.
    * Manipulate the in-game camera and take snapshots.

    It also re-enables the Lua error logging that Maxis disabled in the retail version of the game. Note that due to the way that the game loads plugin Lua scripts, the error messages only give the line number within the script unless the error occurs within a function.
