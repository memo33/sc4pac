    ### Shift + Click Object Copying

    Some objects can be copied by holding down the shift key and clicking on them with the query tool.

    - Buildings: Clicking a building will activate the Place Lot tool with the building's lot selected. Note that the exact building may be different if the lot uses Building Families.
    - Flora: Clicking certain flora types will activate the Place Flora tool with that flora type selected. Note that this only works with the flora objects that have a hover query tool tip.

    ### Extended Terrain Query

    The TerrainQuery command now shows the x, y, and z variables without truncating to the first decimal place, and the cell moisture value is now provided as part of the standard query info.

    - Alternate Terrain Query: This mode is accessed by holding the Alt key. It shows the humidity and ambient wind information, this data appears to be for the entire tile instead of varying per-cell.
    - Pollution Terrain Query: This mode is accessed by holding the Ctrl key. It shows the flammability, land value, and pollution (air, water, garbage, and radiation).

    ### Advanced Query Tool Tips

    These tool tips are accessed by holding Control + Alt + Shift when hovering over an appropriate item.

    - Flora: This tool tip provides the flora object's exemplar name, birth date, and last seeding date.
    - Network: This tool tip provides technical info about the transportation networks, excluding power lines and pipes.
    - Props: This tool tip provides the prop object's exemplar name.

    Moreover, the DLL is a dependency for other Mods, providing services that can be used to add more building query values and/or customize the building and network tool tips.
