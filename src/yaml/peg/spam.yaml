info:
  summary: SimPeg Agricultural Mod (SPAM) - Legacy Version
  warning: |-
    It is crucial to start a new region when installing SPAM, as the mod drastically changes the simulation parameters.
    
    This version is only for compatibility support of already developed regions and for those who cannot upgrade to CAM 2.5 or later

    If you are starting a new region and have met all the requirements of CAM 2.5 or later please install this version

    * `pkg=cam:colossus-addon-mod-spam-controller`
  description: |-
    The **S**im**P**eg **A**gricultural **M**od (**SPAM**) is an absolute, total and complete replacement for the game-default farming system.

    The default system was never really finished before game release and was, in fact, designed to be short-lived and used only initially in starter cities. The game, as it progresses, actually is designed to kill off all desire and usefulness for farming.

    This mod changes all that by not only changing how the farms look, but also how they play.

    Please consult the documentation for further information.
