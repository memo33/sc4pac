  summary: SimPeg Agricultural Mod (SPAM)
  description: |-
    The **S**im**P**eg **A**gricultural **M**od (**SPAM**) is an absolute, total and complete replacement for the game-default farming system.

    The default system was never really finished before game release and was, in fact, designed to be short-lived and used only initially in starter cities. The game, as it progresses, actually is designed to kill off all desire and usefulness for farming.

    This mod changes all that by not only changing how the farms look, but also how they play.

    Please consult the documentation for further information.
