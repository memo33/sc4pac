  description: >
    The Classics is a collection of classic statue props that you can use in the Lot Editor to make parks, museums, art galleries... or whatever your imagination comes up with. Enjoy!!
    
    These custom props are free to use and distribute in lots your create for your own use or to publicly distribute.  If re-distributed, please reference the original prop pack as a dependency. Do not copy and redistribute the original prop material. Most of the props are larger in-game than the their bounding boxes will indicate in the Lot Editor.
