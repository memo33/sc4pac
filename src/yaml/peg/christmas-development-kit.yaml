  description: |-
    Just in time for the Holidays... The PEG Christmas Development Pack contains 10 new seasonal props for developers to use on their lots. Two of the lots, those pictured in the upper images, are year-round props that change during the Holiday season. The other props appear only during the Holidays.

    This kit includes:

    1. Pine Tree/Christmas Tree. A common pine tree throughout the year... but decorated during the Holidays.

    2. Billboard/Nativity Scene.  Typical ad hype for 11 months. Redressed with a beautiful nativity scene for Christmas.

    3. Colored Christmas Lights. A short string of multicolored Christmas lights that can be strung together to decorate your favorite buildings. They only appear during the Holiday season.

    4. Small Nativity Scene. A common painted plywood decoration. Ideal for use on churches, parks or residential front yards. Appears only during the Holidays.

    5. Snowmen. Offered in large and Mucho Grande sizes. Appears only during the Holidays.

    6. Santa Clauses. Two sizes and styles to choose from. Appears only during the Holidays.
