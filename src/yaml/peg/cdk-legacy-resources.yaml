  summary: "PEG-CDK Legacy Resources"
  description: |-
    This PEG-CDK Legacy Resources is a collection of models and props from the old CDK series (CDK, CDK-IND, CDK-COM, CDKN, CDK-OWW, CDK-REC, CDK-SV and RTK3-REC) created by Pegasus. Many of the cases these models were bundled together with the related lots and textures. ~his legacy pack aims to cover situations where one or more of the ancient CDK props are referenced as dependencies for third party uploads (like many early BSC creations).
