  summary: One Flag Many Nations Mod by Pegasus
  description: |
    The One Flag... Many Nations mod allows Lot Developers to place a generic
    flag on their lots which will then display the user's specific or chosen
    national flag when that lot is used in their game. The player decides which
    flag will be displayed by selecting the appropriate package variant.
