  summary: "Network Addon Mod Tunnel and Slope Mod"
  description: >
    This package provides players with additional choices for the slope
    parameters of surface transportation networks in the game.
    This collection of slope mods was designed by Lucario Boricua, author of
    the Earthworks Tutorials series. Extensive research was conducted for both
    other slope mods and the findings of previous precision terraforming pioneers,
    most notably BigRedFish and Ennedi, as well as geometric design
    characteristics of real transportation networks, to best harmonize playability
    and realism.
