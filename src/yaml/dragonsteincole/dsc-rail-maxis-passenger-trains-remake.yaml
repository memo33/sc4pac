  summary: "Replaces Maxis Auotmata with modern versions allowing for graphical bug fixes"
  description: |
    This file contains remade Replacement versions of the vanilla Maxis Passenger train automata. There are two folders for two different nightlighting variations - each folder contains three DAT files, one for Rail, El Rail & Subway, and Monorail.  The Subway version is packed in with the El Rail due to similarity and sharing nightlighting. Bonus points if you actually see one in your playthroughs!
    Whilst the original vanilla models are pretty iconic and still used by most people, these are not meant to be a massive depature or be realistic, as my other automata releases have been. Instead, these are trying to update those originals whilst retaining their charm, and also making them a little nicer to look at overall.
    All the trains and coaches have nightlighting in both Maxis Nite(MN) and Dark Nite(DN) variations, with added details and nightlighting on coaches that were missing it previously.

    **INSTALLATION**

    Drag either the Maxis Nite (MN) or Dark Nite (DN) folders into your 'Plugins' folder. Remove DATs if you do not wish to use those particular automata.

    **COMPATIBILITY**

    Use only one set of DATs, depending on the type of nightlighting you have. All DATs are REPlacement versions, there are no additional versions included.

    **DEPENDENCIES**

    The Dark Nite (DN) versions are best used with Simfox's Day and Nite Modd. They are untested with other night mods.
