  summary: Maxis-like replacement of passenger train automata
  description: |
    Whilst the original vanilla models are pretty iconic and still used by most people, these new models are not meant to be a massive depature or be realistic, as other automata releases have been. Instead, these are trying to update those originals whilst retaining their charm, and also making them a little nicer to look at overall.

    All the trains and coaches have nightlighting in both Maxis Nite(MN) and Dark Nite(DN) variations, with added details and nightlighting on coaches that were missing it previously.
