  description: >
    This is a seasonal tree controller designed to give trees generated by your
    god-mode flora brush the appearance of flora from the Pacific Northwest.
    The lower elevation features maples intersperced among large conifers, the
    middle elevation transitions from large to small conifers, and the upper
    elevation consists of shrubby meadows and small firs.
    It also includes MMPs for each of the brushes used by the God-Mode tool.

    Tree controllers are advanced mods, so be sure to read the documentation carefully.
    Never install more than 1 tree controller at a time.
    When switching to another tree controller, always remove any and all trees
    planted with your previous tree controller *before* uninstalling your old tree controller.
