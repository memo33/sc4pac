  description: |
    This is a seasonal tree controller designed to give trees generated by your god-mode flora
    brush the appearance of a mix of flora from across the Pacific Northwest. It features a
    large selection of flora, including deciduous mixed with conifers, evergreen forests,
    scrubby slopes, meadows, alpine wildflowers, etc. There are 2 versions of this file;
    one with MMPs (mayor-mode ploppables) and one without MMPs.

    Tree controllers are advanced mods, so be sure to read the documentation carefully.
    Never install more than 1 tree controller at a time.
    When switching to another tree controller, always remove any and all trees
    planted with your previous tree controller *before* uninstalling your old tree controller.
