  summary: NDEX N747 Palm Props Vol01
  description: |
    A long time ago N74704 made a set of very large lit palms. BarbyW put them into a prop family and upload them for him to STEX and later to SC4D LEX. The palms can be used either as a family, in which case the colours appear randomly, or as individual palms. These trees are very OTT but fun. They do need power to work and this pack is just the prop pack. There are no lots in here, but they are for anyone to use on their lots and will be used in a forthcoming upload from Nealos101.

    This is a revisited and slightly expanded version of the original one, and it superseds the linked version from STEX.
