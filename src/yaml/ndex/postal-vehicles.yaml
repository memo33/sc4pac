  summary: NDEX Postal Vehicles
  description: |
    This set of files allows postal trucks to be spawned into your cities,
    and cruise around your homes and businesses. Before you can see these
    trucks in your cities, however, you also need to plop some sort of
    Post Office lot in your city.
