  summary: "Small used book store (CS$)"
  description: >
    Renaissance Books is a used book store on Plankinton Avenue in downtown
    Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Although many of the neighboring buildings are filled
    with cafes and charming shops and are generally well maintained, this
    little gem has avoided gentrification. Perfect for your grimier commercial
    streets, or add a little spice to your higher wealth districts!
