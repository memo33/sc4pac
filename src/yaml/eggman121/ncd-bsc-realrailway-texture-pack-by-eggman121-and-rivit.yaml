  summary: "Real RailWay (RRW) Reskin 3rd Party Lot Support"
  description: |
    In order to make the RRW Reskin (a project to enable the recoloring of the Real Railway), a set of Lot Textures has been created for the Original RRW texture colours.
    With the help of a number of modders (spotting, making and testing) a very comprehensive coverage has been achieved - roughly 1100 textures.

    Overrides railway lot textures of:
    1. `pkg=ncd:rail-yard-and-spur-mega-pak-1`
    2. `pkg=bsc:textures-vol01`, `pkg=bsc:textures-vol02`, `pkg=bsc:textures-vol03`
    3. `pkg=aptx:textures-vol01`
    4. Cogeo Textures
    5. MGB204/rsc204 Textures
    6. `pkg=nob:mega-props-vol01`
    7. `pkg=peg:mtp-super-pack`
    8. `pkg=simmer2:rrw-legacy-lottex-mega-texture-pack`
    9. `pkg=wmp:mega-textures`
    10. `pkg=nam:textures`
